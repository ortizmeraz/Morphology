```ad-abstract
This is an introduction to System Thinking and modelling. System Thinking is a common concept for understanding how causal relationships and feedbacks work in an everyday problem. Understanding a cause and an effect enables us to analyse, sort out and explain how changes come about both temporarily and spatially in common problems. This is referred to as mental modelling, i.e. to explicitly map the understanding of the problem and making it transparent and visible for others through Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD). Here we will discuss how to use system thinking and Causal Loop Diagrams to understand and analyse complex problems.

## Bullet points
1. system thinking is a science that deals with the organisation of logic and integration of disciplines for understanding patterns and relations of complex problems.
2. System thinking is also known as principles of organization or theory of self-organization and the way of using it involves “systemic” or “holistic thinking”.
3. System Thinking embeds two other concepts, System Analysis (SA) and System Dynamics (SD) has practical applications through System Analysis and System Dynamics (figure 1).

4. System Analysis is about discovering organisational structures in systems and creating insights into the organisation of causalities. It is about taking a problem apart and reassembling it in order to understand its components and feedback relationships. System Analysis involves group modelling, where we ask the initial question of the problem and create a mental model structure, using Causal Loop Diagrams, to reflect that problem.
5. A model is successful when the thinking behind it is successfully transferred from the model builder to the observer (Haraldsson and Sverdrup, 2003). A model that lacks explanation of its principles is essentially useless.
6. Bogdanov clarified principles of organisation in his theory of Tektology by defining them as the totality of connections among system elements. He identifies three elements that characterise complex systems (Capra, 1997):
	1. Organised complexities, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts;
	2. Disorganised complexities, where the whole is less than the sum of its parts;
	3. Neutral complexities, where the organising and disorganising activities cancel each other.

7. The Neumann group discovered an important feature with system thinking; the ability to shift the attention back and forth between details and wholeness through different levels (system levels) and observe how different kinds of laws act within each system level
8. What is characteristic for solving problems are the so-called “end of pipe” solutions. It is a tactic based on “curing” the symptoms rather than pin the source of a problem. This is not intentionally done by policymakers but rather stems from lack of understanding of how the symptoms manifest.
9. This “short term” approach was the general view to environmental problems since they were not fully understood and not perceived as a direct threat to the society.
10. Some people started to ask if it would not be more reasonable to address the problem of its source, i.e. to deal with the industry that is primarily responsible for the sulphur emissions. That approach was much more complex and involved much broader definition of the problem, i.e. involved the participation of the emission countries.
11. We all have and use mental models in our daily work to simplify how the world works around us (Dörner, 1996). This mental model of reality we use continuously to learn and analyse situations and making decisions. Normally we don’t have problems with our mental “reasoning” because it appears to work in most cases, e.g. balancing the check book at the end of the month.
12. ...consequence we tend to develop routines and skills that are based on our mental models...
13. These routines seem very simple and obvious and not necessarily connected to mental modelling, but we have grown unconscious of our routines since the models we have developed about them are working just fine and they involve instant reaction.
14. The human mind best understands models that are linear and static, which describe a set of linear relationships that do not change over time.
15. Static models are “frozen” models or so-called linear models where time is not an independent variable.
16. We only encounter problems when our static representation of reality (routines and skills) is inefficient to simplify the complexity of the real world …
17. Most problems are dynamic, and that means that variables and relations vary with time. The most essential factors concerning dynamic behaviour are the feedbacks. In a dynamic behaviour the feedback is determined by time or the so-called time lag.
18. When we work with system thinking we work with the concept of “feedback”. Feedback is responsible for changes within systems, i.e. action causing reaction. Feedback does not mean opinion or encouraging remarks.
19. A bicycle can be considered as a system or a whole where its functions are dependent on interactions of its parts....In isolation, the parts can never be identified as a bicycle because the function of the bicycle is not embedded into individual parts but into the interaction between all of its parts.
20. What is essential in this aspect is the bicycle rider. Without the rider the behaviour of the “bicycle system” does not exist. We have now made distinction between the parts and the whole.
21. Let us now look at a natural system. Properties of a forest cannot be analysed just by looking at one tree. Factors such as the climate, grazing animals, soil and topography, are components, which characterise a forest and can thus not be excluded if we want to understand a forest as a whole.
22. People and society are also a system. …We as individuals stand fragile alone, because our capacity for survival is limited. In a group we can specialise and have certain functions, which collectively benefit the group as a whole, and for the individual.
23. Another example of a large system is a city, which can be viewed as a system whose purpose is to provide employment, housing and other social benefits for its inhabitants. People have specialised jobs and functions in the society but collectively we all increase the quality of life of all the individuals.
24. All systems are defined by its boundaries. In order for us to understand a system properly we need to understand how systems behave and what their properties are. 
25. The principle of system thinking is that all behaviour in a system is a consequence of its structure. The structure of a system determines its development, success and failure.
26. Of course we cannot solve all problems within our defined boundaries. This is because a system contains sub-systems and is always embedded within a larger system.
27. **Identifying complexity**
28. It is important to understand dynamic complexity and not detailed complexity. When we construct our mental model and define our system we need to be aware of the level of details. Generalisation is often the key to understanding complex systems.
29. When we create mental models we do not intend to capture the whole reality in one model.
30. What we want to do is to map part of the reality in such a way that it gives us a basic understanding of the complex problem.
31. We can now observe how systems are integrated into other systems. Variables that we choose are in fact sub-systems themselves and their components also sub-systems and etc.
32. Figure 11: Large systems incorporate many variables which requires more generalisation and accurately refining of the question we want to answer. Notice that with increased physical scale of the system the time dimension changes and our generalisation for the variables in our study (Haraldsson and Sverdrup, 2003).

33. Identifying the system level and its boundaries requires great consideration on defining the problem and asking the basic questions we want answers to (Haraldsson and Sverdrup, 2003). It requires a group effort from individuals that are stakeholders in the problem or have invested interest.
34. **Sorting the problem**
35. System Thinking starts by defining a problem. Defining a problem often requires a group work with relevant stakeholders and problem owners. All the key variables relevant to the question are listed. Ideally the variables relevant to both the question and the answer to the problem should be discovered during the process.
36. ... the variables should be sorted according to spatial and temporal influence...
37. We should also sort out in our problem what are “soft” variables within the system.
38. It is also possible to use variables that are information such as “policy” or “mental capacity”.
39. **Understanding Causal Loop Diagrams**
40. The function of CLD’s is to map out the structure and the feedbacks of a system in order to understand its feedback mechanisms. ... so we can develop strategies to work with, or counteract the behaviour. ...what extent and how the problem is connected with other “systems”.
41. CLDs describe the reality through causalities between variables and how they form a dynamic circular influence. We want to observe the world through feedbacks rather than linearly. We want to observe repeated patterns that may be used to predict the  behaviour in the problem. It’s about understanding cause and effect.
42. The CLD allows us to follow the action in details and we can read the “feedback” in the CLD like a story.
43. Both the statements express the same intention but describe the process in a different way. As observed, the effects of the last variable influence the input of the first variable (the one we started with), which results in a self-regulation of the system, indicated with a “B” for balancing, in the middle of the loop.
44. Systems always behave in a circular organization forming feedback loops.
45. The Causal Loop concept explained (adopted from Roberts et al. 1983, p56)
46. Explanation 1: connecting the links.

47. on the loop you can erase the small assisting arrows. They are only there to help us determine the loop behaviour.
48. Explanation 3: Job opportunities and people moving to town. It is very important to understand that once we have put polarities on the causality links, they always stay the same.

49. Explanation 4: how to read, starting with a decrease.

50. Explanation 5: Assigning polarities and behaviour to a loop.
51. The loop is a balancing system, indicated with B, since the last variable, “Measures” is influencing Pollution (›fl) in the opposite direction. (If we would have a system that had starting and ending arrows in the same directions (››) we would have a reinforcing system, indicated with R).

52. Explanation 7: Different alternatives of RBP graph behaviour.

53. Figure 15: All loops and systems can in basic terms be categorized according to the above principles or combination of them.
54. All systems have some kind of delay, which can range from seconds to days, centuries or millions of years. Delays are what cause systems to fluctuate. A delay is when an action between two components in a system is much slower than the rest of the system.

·         ![](file:///C:/Users/Omar/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image018.jpg)

55. Like before, drawing a delay is a conceptual exercise for us to understand how the delay is affecting the system.
56. Delays are hard to predict within a system. Most of the time we do not know how long the delay period is so we tend to use trial and error approach to assess the delay time…
57. Observing a RBP can also be done by looking at each loop in the CLD as isolated and drawing the behaviour for each one of them. The sum of the results from each of the loops is then used to predict the RBP from the whole CLD.
58. **Working with the CLD- the Learning Loop**
59. A Causal Loop Diagram is only interesting if it answers the right questions posed from a problem. How we understand a problem is how we ask the questions.
60. First of all, there needs to be a problem definition, i.e. it has to be real enough so you can create boundaries around the problem and put it into context with its surroundings.
61. Our task always starts by defining the problem and what symptoms are emerging  it.
