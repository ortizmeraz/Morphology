# The articulations between the land use, the urban form, and the transit network.


Explore the articulations formed between the configurations between the the land use, the urban form, and the transit network using the node place approach. Where the functionality of the system to provide accessibility to daily activities. It evaluates the different accessibility levels the system entails to every point. Where the priority of access is defined by daily needs. This changes according to the necessity and scale. 

The research looks at the same time, all the articulations conforming the system through conceptual  and systemic models. As examining the relationship between selected constituent elements of the city in a void makes difficult to asses causation. 



The land-use question works around the categories of services and amenities and the way they are distributed in the urban tissue. A typology of service/amenities distribution areas will catalog the urban tissue categories by describing the quality of life associated to the urban tissues from the urban question. 

### **Extent** 
- This question starts: by exploring the spatial distribution and configuration of services and amenities within the urban tissue in conjunction with the transit network.
- This question covers: the quality of life and sustainability that different configurations of urban tissue and transit network grant to the urban dwellers 
- The research objective is: to assess accessibility potential to primary commercial and community amenities and services  created by the interactions of **urban forms**, **public transport systems**, and **land-use patterns**.
- The question ends with:  with a theoretical/partial application in Montreal and the associated topology
