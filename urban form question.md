# The systemic reading of urban from   
From a systemic perspective, how things fit together. How the manifest a system when they are articulated in specific ways. They can be characterized. measured, and compared. (characterized through quantification)

Based on the postulate that urban morphology is based on walking. The form, path and topology can be quantified.  
This is altered by the specific mode of transportation. The characters of the form follow the capacity of transportation. 
Redensification is part of the growth in population, when transportation does not change. 
When motorized mass transit was implemented, the creation of more specialized tissues. Where you can have a disconnection from the domestic real and the work realm. 

The generalization of the automobility changed the way new configurations replicated. 
THe urban form speaks about the built environment as a complex system.
Urban morphology characterizes the combination patterns of the [[urban tissue]]. Taking in consideration the scale and transformations it suffers 
when circumstances change. Where new configurations emerge when new means of transportation. 
If everything is predicated in walking, the [[urban tissue]] will not change until a new mean of transportation is super imposed. 

A compact city associated with high quality of life and efficient that has well integrated land uses is not the result of a single factor but the conjunction of several systems. 

The relationship between land use and transportation are looking into causality. When the articulations are built at the same time. 

Different configurations come from different approaches, limitations, and constrains to the transportation.

First understand what is urban morphology and what it brings to the table. 

Urban morphology will bring to the research:
- a systemic way to understand the city
- it can produce configuration typology
- helps understand the replication of space (morphogenesis)
- to look into how different configurations are products of different way to move



___

The urban question focuses on the study of the urban configurations and the associated capacity they have to provide with access to amenities and services through the public transit network.
This questions covers the shapes and arrangements of the urban tissue and the transit network.

### **Extent** 
- This question starts: with an analysis of the urban shapes
- This question covers: the areas of catchment of the transit network
- The research objective is: to construct a theoretical/methodological approach to asses the different urban tissue configurations in regards to the public transit network
- The question ends with: a typology of accessibility to the transit network in Montreal 
- 

## Concepts to work 
- [[-Concepts/urban tissue|Urban tissue]]
	- Urban typologies


## Things to search for
- Systemic approach 
- How the cities were created in function of walking
