```ad-abstract
Transit-oriented development (TOD) is based around transit stations, with the emphasis on high population density and multifunctional areas in promoting sustainable mobility. This study aimed to develop a TOD model that could achieve an optimum land use allocation to maximize transit ridership. A critical literature review, an analysis of value engineering through function and benchmarking studies were conducted in order to develop a baseline plan for a TOD model, which was then optimized using linear programming. A total of four light rail transit (LRT) stations located in Jakarta were used as the case study to represent model implementation, ridership evaluation and optimal design. The optimization results showed that office workers constituted the highest number of transit passengers, followed by those working in hotels and commercial/retail and residential users. It was also found that optimizing the design of the TOD can increase the number of daily LRT passengers by up to 55%.

## Bullet points
1. There are numerous factors related to the rail transit farebox revenue. A key problem-causing factor is the interaction between the transit infrastructure and its surrounding area.
2. This paper intended to fill the gap of previous research by offering a linear programming-based optimization model of land use allocation at the parcel-level of rail-based TOD to maximize rail transit ridership.
3. This research is a typical choice task of a linear programming problem, aimed at obtaining an optimum gross floor area (GFA) for each property development as an alternative approach to transit operation and property development planning in order to achieve the maximum rate of passenger trips.
4. Occasionally, land use development has worked in line with the transit system, yet they failed to connect morphologically. Therefore, the term ‘’oriented” only meant ‘’adjacent” (Transit Adjacent Development/TAD).
5. This paper investigated three TOD properties as the benchmark, which were selected due to their relative success in implementing Cervero’s ‘D variables’ in each development, as well as their different development scales and data availability.
