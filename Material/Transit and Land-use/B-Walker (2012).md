Public transit is a powerful tool for addressing a huge range of urban problems, including traffic congestion and economic development as well as climate change. But while many people support transit in the abstract, it's often hard to channel that support into good transit investments. In Human Transit, Jarrett Walker supplies the basic tools, the critical questions, and the means to make smarter decisions about designing and implementing transit services. Human Transit explains the fundamental geometry of transit that shapes successful systems; the process for fitting technology to a particular community; and the local choices that lead to transit-friendly development. Whether you are in the field or simply a concerned citizen, here is an accessible guide to achieving successful public transit that will enrich any community.

## Bullet points
1. Page 14
2. When our elected leaders make decisions about transit, they face a noisy mix of competing interests. A senior citizen has trouble walking to a bus stop, so wants the stops placed closer together. Others want the bus stops farther apart, so that the buses run faster. A merchant wants the bus to deviate into his shopping center, to bring customers. Another merchant wants the bus out of his shopping center, because it’s bringing “undesirable” people. Suburb A wants a proposed rail transit line to go underground through their community, to preserve their ambience. Farther out on the proposed line, Suburb B wants the whole line elevated, so that the line is cheap enough to get all the way to Suburb B in its first phase.
3. Page 16
4. A core idea of this book is that we will have clearer conversations, and make better decisions, if we distinguish carefully between values and expertise and understand their interplay in our transit debates.
5. Values are statements about your community’s ideals, goals, and priorities. They answer questions like these:
	- What is transit’s purpose? How should we measure the results of our transit system? Ridership? Emissions? Complaints?- What counts as adequate and useful transportation? What, for example, is the minimum level of quality that transit should be aiming for?
	- What kind of city do you want? Transit, like all transportation infrastructure, can have big impacts on the form, feel, and functioning of your city, so it’s important to understand those impacts in advance.
	- Page 17
	- By definition, these questions are hard, because they’re about choosing between different things that you like. Your plumber is asking you if you’d like to save money now or have a more permanent fix. “Both” is not a useful answer. A transit expert helping your community has to ask many similar questions. Here are some of the big ones that we’ll explore:
	- Is transit mostly about serving a peak-period or “rush hour” commute pattern, or is its top priority to provide a consistent service all day?(chapter 6)
	- Would you rather have a direct but infrequent service or a more frequent service that requires a connection? (chapter 12)
	- Is the goal of your transit system to carry as many people as possible? Or to serve disadvantaged persons who really need the service? Or something else? Or is it a balance of these, and if so, where do you strike that balance?

6. Page 18
7. Technology choices do matter, but the fundamental geometry of transit is exactly the same for buses, trains, and ferries. If you jump too quickly to the technology choice question but get the geometry wrong, you’ll end up with a useless service no matter how attractive its technology is.
8. The physical design of cities determines transit outcomes far more than transit planning does. Your particular location in the city, and the nature of the development and street patterns, will govern the quality of transit you can expect. For that reason, one of the most urgent needs related to transit is to help people make smarter decisions about where to locate their homes and businesses, depending on the level of transit mobility that matters to them.

10. **1 WHAT TRANSIT IS AND DOES**
11. Public transit consists of regularly scheduled vehicle trips, open to all paying passengers, with the capacity to carry multiple passengers whose trips may have different origins, destinations, and purposes.
	- “regularly scheduled vehicle trips”: Transit is provided by a vehicle running on a regular schedule or pattern.
	- “open to all paying passengers”: The word public in public transit means “open to the entire public.” This word can be confusing in debates about whether transit should be operated by the government or by the private sector.
	- Page 24
	- “that can carry multiple passengers”: The ability to carry many people with a single vehicle is the defining virtue of transit, and the most basic measure of its efficiency.
	- “whose trips may have different origins, destinations, and purposes”: At its core, transit is about multiple people riding in one vehicle even though they are not intentionally traveling together or even going to the same places.

12. Page 26
13. So transit has the potential for a mutually beneficial relationship with most of the other alternatives to the private car.
	- Walking is an intrinsic feature of almost all transit trips, so all transit advocates must be pedestrian advocates.
	-  Cycling can compete with local transit but tends to complement longer distance rapid transit, especially when investments are made in securebicycle storage at stations.
14. Page 29
15. Most of the time, though, our travel isn’t motivated by a sheer desire for movement; it’s motivated by the need to do something—to make some kind of economic or personal contact—that is too far away to walk to. In most cases, we don’t want movement. We want access.
16. Access is the ability to complete some desired personal or economic transaction. Your mobility can be visualized as where you can go in a given time.
17. Access is how many useful or valuable things you can do.
18. Page 30
19. In other words, much of the work of access is about eliminating the need to move your body around the city in order to complete the economic and personal transactions that make up a life.
20. So personal mobility—the freedom to move—is the direct product of public transit.
21. If we want cities to be built in ways that require less travel—that is, if we want cities with better access—we will need to ensure that those cities still have generous transit mobility.

23. **2 WHAT MAKES TRANSIT USEFUL? SEVEN DEMANDS AND HOW TRANSIT SERVES THEM**
24. Page 33
25. In the hundreds of hours I’ve spent listening to people talk about their transit needs, I’ve heard seven broad expectations that potential riders have of a transit service that they would consider riding:
	1. It takes me where I want to go.
	2. It takes me when I want to go.
	3. It is a good use of my time.
	4. It is a good use of my money.
	5. It respects me in the level of safety, comfort, and amenity it provides.
	6. I can trust it.
	7. It gives me freedom to change my plans.
26. Page 34
27. These seven demands, then, are dimensions of the mobility that transit provides. They don’t yet tell us how good we need the service to be, but they will help us identify the kinds of goodness we need to care about. In short, we can use these as a starting point for defining useful service.
28. Page 35
29. *Demand 1: “It Takes Me Where I Want to Go”* The first demand—“it takes me where I want to go”—involves two key measurable features of a transit system: First, the location of stops and stations determines how close transit service comes to each place that anyone might want to come from or go to.

33. Page 37
34. *Demand 2: “It Takes Me When I Want To Go”* The second demand also encompasses two measurable features. First is the question of whether transit runs at all when you need it; the answer to this is the span of service. Next is the question of whether the service runs often enough that you can leave when you really want to go.
35. Frequency is one of the most misunderstood concepts in transit.
36. Page 41
37. Another important legibility technique is to minimize the difference between the transit network and the street network, the latter of which you can assume your customers already know. This legibility is not the result of just a well-phrased sign. It’s also the result of planners deciding that it’s best for transit to just run the length of Geary Boulevard, rather than branch off of it in complicated ways that could never be described or remembered so easily.
38. Page 43
39. Another useful way to sort the elements of useful service is to think about how they relate to the phases of a transit trip. Any trip on transit has the following phases or steps, and in each one we seek both an efficient use of our time and money and a civilized experience.
	1. Understanding. First, you must form a sufficient understanding of the service, frequency, and fare to know how to make the trip. This is the role of legibility as discussed earlier.
	2. Accessing (at the origin). You then walk, drive, or cycle to the stop or station where you will board the service. Here, there are limits to what your transit agency can do, apart from locating the stop at a logical place, making it a civilized place to wait, and providing parking options for your car or bike, where appropriate.
	3. Waiting. Waiting is everyone’s least favorite phase of a trip. It’s governed mostly by frequency and reliability, but of course the quality of the waiting environment has a big impact.
	4. Paying. We think of paying as spending money, but paying can also cost time, especially if you are unfamiliar with the system.
	5. Riding. The time spent on the transit vehicle is governed by average speed (or delay) and reliability.
	6. Connecting. If your trip requires a connection, you’ll repeat steps 2 through 5 for that connection. Minimizing the hassle of these steps is the work of connectivity,
	7. Accessing (at the destination). Finally, you’ll repeat step 2 in reverse, traveling by some means from the transit stop/station to your actual destination.
40. Page 55
41. **4 LINES, LOOPS, AND LONGING**
42. Directness is a fact of geometry, so it will always be there. Speed, by contrast, is the result of complex and often ephemeral things: weather conditions, the behavior of other travelers, fare collection methods, the overall demand for travel. Speed is worth fighting for on all of those fronts, and a few features of speed—such as the exclusive right-of-way followed by rapid transit lines—are locked into infrastructure design in a way that makes them reliable. (We’ll explore those in chapter 8.) Still, speed can change, but directness won’t. So planners try to make transit as direct as it can be while still doing its job.
43. Page 56
44. If a transit route is not direct, compared to the alternatives, we say it is circuitous (figure 4-1). A small bit of circuitousness on an otherwise direct route is called a deviation.
45. Page 58
46. Once a city has become two-dimensional, with important points that are not in a straight line, transit has a choice (figure 4-2).
	- You can specialize. You can decide to serve only some of these points, so that transit can run a straight line.
	- You can run a circuitous line, serving all the dots at the expense of not being direct between them. This is sometimes done in transit networks aiming to provide basic coverage, often for social service purposes but with no intention of competing with other alternatives.
	- You can run multiple lines, each of which can be direct. For example, you can run a direct line between each pair of dots. Or, you can use fewer lines but make sure they connect with one another.
47. BARRIERS AND CHOKEPOINTS
48. If a transit service area contains a barrier that applies to all competing forms of transport, then a transit line may bend to go through that barrier and still be called direct. The barrier can be a body of water, a mountain range, or anything else that obstructs direct travel. The limited number of points where you can cross a barrier are called chokepoints. For car traffic, choke points are a problem, but for transit, they are opportunities.
49. Page 63
50. When someone wants all parts of an area to be connected, and tries to express this in the language of transit, they often talk about loops. The loop is an appealing image because it’s a thing that transit can do that seems to encompass an entire two-dimensional area with a feeling of completeness and closure. I have lost count of how many times people have explained their mobility needs to me by saying, “We need some kind of loop.” But there’s a problem with loops, and it’s so obvious that it’s easy to forget: very few people want to travel in circles. Most people experience their travel desires as “I am here and I need to be there.” The desire for transportation is a feeling about two points of space, “here” and “there.” In the geometry of cities, the shape of that desire is a straight line connecting those points.
51. Page 64
52. Many commuter express bus lines are also one-way. Loops, however, are easy to run one-way. In fact, a two-way loop line is usually operated as though it were two one-way loops, running continuously in opposite directions. But if a loop runs in only one direction, you may have to ride more than halfway around the loop to get where you’re going. So they work only in two settings.
53. First, in very low-ridership areas, such as circulation in low-density suburbs, the one-way loop is the cheapest way to cover a lot of area in a given time.
54. Page 65
55. The other application for one-way loops is in very small circulation networks, such as in an airport or downtown, where the whole loop is soshort that it doesn’t matter much if you go the long way around it.
56. Page 67
57. **5 TOUCHING THE CITY: STOPS AND STATIONS**
58. We usually visualize the area served by a stop as a circle around the stop (figure 5-1). There’s a small ring defining the area from which you can walk to the stop. A larger ring is the area from which you can cycle. A much larger area can reach the stop by car, in one of two modes:
	- Park-and-ride,
	- Dropoff,means being driven to the stop by someone else
59. Page 69
60. But while there are many ways to get to a transit stop, we plan for one method above all: walking. Sooner or later, everyone is a pedestrian.
61. How big is the walk radius?...the walking distance that most people seem to tolerate—the ...one beyond which ridership falls off dramatically—is about a quarter mile (400 m) for a local-stop service, but farther for a faster service.
62. Page 70
63. First, the duplicate coverage area is the area that has more than one stop within walking distance.
64. Second, the coverage gap is the area that is within walking distance of the line but not of a stop. As we move stops farther apart, the coverage gap grows.
65. We would like to minimize both of these things, but in fact we have to choose between them. Close stop spacing means smaller coverage gaps but larger duplicate coverage area. Wide stop spacing means the opposite.
66. Page 71
67. A slope might shift the calculation. Walking downhill is usually easier than walking uphill, so if a transit line is climbing or descending, some people will value having two stops so that they can walk downhill to one to depart, and walk downhill from the other one as they’re returning.
68. Page 72
69. The European HiTrans guides suggest that a spacing of 0.4 mile (600 m) “looks sensible” for local stops in continuously developed areas.5 Actual European practice is usually in the range of 0.12 to 0.25 mile (200 to 400 m) for locally oriented services, but wider where demand is higher.
70. the distinction is important, and we need words to describe it, so in this book I will use local, rapid, and express with these meanings:
	- Local means serving closely spaced stops such that all points on or nearthe line are within walking distance of a stop.
	- Rapid means regularly but widely spaced stops, usually every half mile (800 m) or more. Rapid spacing generally serves a series of areas around the stations rather than a continuous area along the whole line.
	- Express, as I use the word in this book, means serving a long nonstop segment.b Typical express service is focused on a single major destination, such as a downtown...Express service is inherently specialized, so it is frequently offered only during the peak commute period. Rail transit includes not just the high-capacity rapid transit of big-city subways, for example, but also the streetcar or tram, which may run in local-stop mode just like a local bus. Buses can be local, but they can also be rapid. When they are the latter, they’re called limited-stop or rapid bus or Bus Rapid Transit.

75. Table 5-1 Stopping Patterns, Rail versus Bus
76. Transit systems that have a social service history have typically focused on local service—often with very close stop spacing—because easy access to the service was presumed to be more important than speed.
77. The North American tendency with heavy urban bus lines has been to run local service all the time as frequently as possible, and to add limited-stop service only when and where there is a surge of demand. In the past ten years, however, there’s been a dramatic shift toward all day frequent Rapid bus services, bus lines that run in rapid mode at high frequency for a long service day.
78. Page 76
79. Imagine, for a moment, an alternate vision of transit in which the first priority was to move people quickly over longer distances, with a product that stopped only every half mile (800 m) or more but that was fast enough to be worth walking to? Local services attract most of their riders from a quarter-mile (400 m) radius, but people often walk farther to get to a Rapid stop. If we made that the standard, then in a grid of arterials half a mile apart, everyone is within acceptable walking distance of a Rapid stop (figure 5-5). Such a product would assume that the communities it serves are walkable, and would aim to complement walking rather than competing with it.
80. If that were the vision, the Rapid would be the primary product, and the locals would be secondary;
81. Page 78
82. The question of how to balance local with Rapid service is tied to a big question that will dominate chapter 10: ridership or coverage? Are you designing our transit system mainly for high ridership, with the environmental and fare revenue benefits of that? Or, are you running a social service designed to help smaller numbers of people with limited ability or willingness to walk? If the latter, clearly you’ll run a network of slow local services that are easy to walk to. But if ridership is the goal, and your trip distances are long, you’ll run as much Rapid service as you can, with a stop spacing calculated to optimize total trip times (including walking, waiting, and riding) overall.
83. The balance of Rapid versus local service also affects sustainability goals. .... comes down to this: The faster transit runs, the more it competes with cars. The slower it runs, the more it competes with walking.
84. Page 79
85. LINE SPACING IS STOP SPACING
86. Finally, the geometry that governs stop spacing also governs the spacing of parallel lines. In the Los Angeles example, the half-mile (800 m) spacing of parallel lines ensures that the quarter-mile (400 m) walk radius from one line doesn’t overlap the walk radius of the other. If it does, you’re providing duplicate service to the same people, which is always less useful than providing unique service for different people.
87. One of the most common mistakes in transit planning is to invent a new line, in response to some political initiative, without thinking about how it affects the existing lines that it may overlap. Overlaying new lines on top of existing ones is politically easy, but by creating duplicate coverage, it often leads to a less efficient network overall.
88. Page 115
89. **9 DENSITY DISTRACTIONS**
90. residential density.... This is not the only kind of density that matters to transit; the density of jobs and other activities is equally fundamental. Density is also not the sole determinant of ridership; service matters, obviously, but so do urban design features such as walkability, as well as the pricing of transit compared to a customer’s alternatives.
91. Page 116
92. a strong relationship between residential density and transit outcomes is both empirically and geometrically obvious. This is not to say that other factors don’t matter.
93. whenever we talk about urban form, people hear us making judgments about their homes.How a certain kind of development pattern implies certain consequences for transit, and thus for sustainability, and thus for the human future.
94. **10 RIDERSHIP OR COVERAGE? THE CHALLENGE OF SERVICE ALLOCATION**
95. Page 118
96. What matters to transit is the density around the transit system’s stops and stations, especially those that offer a high level of mobility. To talk about this coherently, we need to be able to measure density in a very fine-grained way. If you believe that one quarter mile (400 m) is a reasonable walking “How many residents and jobs are within one quarter mile (400 m) of a stop?”
97. Page 119       
98. The average density of our city may tell us nothing about the prospects for transit, but if we speak instead of the percentage of citizens who live at high density, we get closer.
99. Page 120
100. In any case, don’t be distracted by the average density of your entire urban area, or even of your city. Forget, too, about the notion that transit advocates want to force “everyone” to live at higher density. It’s the density near stops and stations that will determine the size of a city’s transit market, and thus its transit outcomes.
101. Page 121
102. The question of how much service to run in low-density areas is part of one of the most challenging plumber’s questions: are we planning for ridership or for coverage? It’s time to confront that question.
103. Page 123
104. Transit also faces a contradictory mission. You can see it in two types of goals that most agencies adopt but rarely reconcile. Most agencies have two goals that sound something like this:
	1. Serve all parts of our community.
	2. Maximize ridership with our fixed service budget.

105. The first goal, called a Coverage Goal, says that the agency must serve everyone in its service area—that is, everyone who pays taxes to the agency and votes for the elected officials who will make decisions about transit. Implicit in the Coverage Goal is that some service must be provided regardless of how few people use it.
106. The second goal is a Ridership Goal. It calls for deploying service the way private business would, with the aim of the highest possible ridership for a given service budget. The Ridership Goal is implicit in measures such as “farebox recovery,” the percentage of operating cost recovered by fares.
107. Page 124
108. Coverage service aims for riders, too, but implicitly judges its success not on how many people it carries but on how badly they need the service, and on how much of the city or region has been covered.
109. The Ridership Goal, by contrast, is to carry as many riders as possible for the fixed budget. Since operating budgets are driven mostly by labor cost, which varies by the hour, the Ridership Goal is mostly focused on maximizing ridership per service hour, where a “service hour” is one transit vehicle operating for one hour.
110. Ridership Goals serve two major public interests. First, if your aim is to compete successfully with cars to achieve environmental benefits, a Ridership Goal is most likely to do that. But if you’re thinking about transit like a business, you want maximum fare revenue, and in that case you’ll also be drawn to the Ridership Goal.
111. Often, a transit agency will adopt both goals in some form but will never resolve the conflict between them. With this move, they hurl their staff in opposite directions at once. In the worst cases, the contradictory goals can make it impossible for a competent staff to do their jobs, which in turn can cause the loss of the best employees. Nobody wants to work at a job where every time they do anything to pursue goal A, they will be blasted for undermining the conflicting goal B, and vice versa.
112. Page 126
113. Denseville has twice as many people as Sparseville The real explanation is simpler than that: Denseville has more riders because it has more people, and more activities, in the fixed area within walking distance of any transit stop. If everyone in these debates could keep that basic geometric fact in mind, we’d have fewer hurt feelings all around.
114. Page 128
115. Now the ridership on our 2-mile segment of line can be calculated like this:
116. Ridership = Population X Rate of Transit Use per Person
117. Denseville is only twice as dense as Sparseville, but Denseville’s transit ridership on the same amount of service will more than double that of Sparseville. It’s a bit more complicated than that, but not much. Spillar and Rutherford looked at several cities in the western United States and found that the relationship between density and transit demand has three distinct phases:
	- In rural development, up to about 5 dwelling units per acre (12 units per hectare), demand is at a very low level, rising slowly in direct proportion to density.
	- From 5 dwelling units per acre up to about 20 dwelling units per acre (50 units per hectare), demand rises faster than density, in the upward curve that we sketched above. This is the range in which most urban development in the New World occurs, outside of the densest urban cores. Both Denseville and Sparseville will be in this range, so this is the hard fact that governs how we apportion service between them.
	- Above 20 dwelling units per acre, the steep curve starts to flatten out. At these high urban densities, people live so close to so many of their daily needs that walking trips begin to take a large share of the market at the expense of transit.
118. Page 130
119. Trip generation and attraction is a hard thing to count, so we approximate. We count residents and jobs (and often student enrollments) because most governments know where those things are. We know that commutes to work and school are not the only trip purpose or even the most important one, but they are the easiest to measure.
120. Page 131
121. the big picture, which is defined by these two huge facts of geometry. First, residential density is a major factor governing ridership, and second, over the prevailing density range of our urban areas, a doubling of residential density will more than double the transit demand.
122. Page 132
123. The Coverage Goal is extreme, but it is quite common in smaller cities where transit is thought of primarily as a lifeline service for the dependent, not as a means of competing with the automobile.
124. On the surface, many people would agree with the principle of the Coverage Goal: that residents should all enjoy the same quality of service, regardless of the density at which they live. Someone who asks, “Why do they have good service and I don’t?” is invoking a Coverage Goal.
125. Page 133
126. To make the service fairer, then, we might propose an Equity Goal: “Service shall be allocated proportional to population.” if we implement the Equity Goal, the buses in Denseville will still be more crowded. Under the Coverage Goal,
127. Denseville’s buses are three times as crowded as Sparseville’s.
128. In fact, they’re a bit more crowded than that, because in shifting from the Coverage Goal to the Equity Goal, we’ve now introduced a measurable difference in frequency.
129. Page 134
130. Think about it another way: if we cut an hour of bus service in Sparseville, where it carried, say, ten people, and add that hour of service in Denseville, where it may carry thirty people, then the ridership of our transit system goes up, even though the cost of running the service is the same.
	- The Coverage Goal apportions service regardless of density. (Denseville and Sparseville get the same service.)
	- The Equity Goal apportions service proportional to density. (Denseville gets twice as much service as Sparseville because it has twice the population.)
	- The Ridership Goal apportions service in response to the observed pattern of demand. (Denseville generates more than twice as much demand as Sparseville, so it gets more than twice as much service.)
131. Page 138
132. because density, service, and ridership are all feeding off of one another, each growing because the other two are growing. That path can lead to denser and also much more sustainable cities, where transit plays a huge role in mobility while walking and cycling, supplemented by carsharing, do much of the rest.
133. Page 139
134. If the goal is to drive down car ownership and car dependence for environmental reasons, the best place to do that is in Denseville, and in those Sparsevilles that choose to become more like Denseville, because there, the feedback loop of service, ridership, and density is something that the political process can build on. As an area gets denser and fewer people own cars, it becomes possible to change many of the policies that get in the way of creating great urban places—policies around parking supply, for example, as well as zoning. Transit will be helping to build the city.
135. Page 151
136. **12 CONNECTIONS OR COMPLEXITY?**
137. if a transit agency wants me to do a network plan that will increase its ridership and efficiency, I almost always have to delete some direct services and introduce connections.
138. Page 152
139. Connection-free networks can work well in one instance: where absolutely everyone is going to the same destination. Such networks are called many to-one, because their purpose is to link many places where people live to a single place where, we assume, everyone is going. They’re also called radial, because all lines extend from a single point.
140. If you do have a really dominant downtown and few other destinations of importance, a radial network may be a decent approximation of what your community needs. If you’re a small town with a big university, you may well want a network that radiates from the university, because most of your riders are going there.
141. Page 153
142. But if you’re a transit system serving an typical city, with many centers of activity that people want to get to, you have a many-to-many demand pattern. At this point, you face a plumber’s question: connections or complexity? If you try to serve a many-to-many demand pattern but try to avoid connections, you’ll produce a network that’s massively complex and much less frequent than it could otherwise be.
143. Page 157
144. CONNECTIONS FREE US FROM COMPLEXITY
145. Even in the simplified abstract city that I’ve used in this example, the Connective network has one more crucial advantage: it’s simpler. That’s important if you want to move around your city spontaneously on transit, as opposed to just making one regular trip.
146. Page 163
147. Here, then, is the geometry problem around connections:
	- A Connective network covers the same area with far fewer routes.
	- Operating cost rises with frequency and also rises with route distance.
	- Low frequency and shorter span mean:
		- More waiting.
		- Greater likelihood that your trip, and thus your life, will be constrained by the transit schedule.
		- A higher risk that your trip will be disrupted by a reliability problem with a single vehicle.
	- In addition, a system of overlapping lines trying to provide direct service yields a more complex network, which means:
		- A more bewildering map and information system that can discourage people exploring the service for the first time.
		-  Much more information to be learned in order to make each trip.
		-  Greater difficulty in keeping the network geography in your head, which reduces the ease with which you can use the service spontaneously to move around the city, as people living no-car or low-car lifestyles need to do.
148. To avoid connections, then, we must sacrifice frequency, span, and simplicity.
149. we find we’ve compromised three of our seven demands for transit:
	• It takes me when I want to go. Low frequency and short span make this less likely.
	Page 164
	• I can trust it. At low frequency, a broken-down or late transit vehicle can leave you stranded. At high frequency, another will be along soon.
	• It gives me the freedom to change my plans. Spontaneous travel is harder due to low frequency, short span, and barriers to understanding caused by complexity.
150. Which of these two clouds of geometrically connected values are you going to embrace, given a decentralized city with many destinations of interest?
	- Connection avoidance + poor frequency + short span + complexity + focus on few destinations, or
	- Connections + high frequency + long span + simplicity + usefulness to many destinations.
151. Page 165
152. If you want to avoid connections, then embrace complexity and accept the problems it raises, including low frequency, short span, and barriers to new riders. If you want to escape complexity and build frequency and span, you need to encourage connections. You decide.
153. Page 166
154. **13 FROM CONNECTIONS TO NETWORKS TO PLACES**
155. In designing a connective network, then, we have to care about two aspects of each connection point:
	- Timing. Is the connection point’s position in the network conducive to fast connections?
	- Environment. We care about three dimensions here:
		- Is it a safe and pleasant place to wait? Does the connection require a walk, and if so, is it safe and pleasant, both day and night and in all typical kinds of weather?
		- Does the site lend itself to reliable operations, keeping transit vehicles out of congestion or other causes of delay?
		- Does it offer additional ridership potential? If a transit network organizes itself around connection point C, that means C will have an unusually high level of transit service, because lines will be radiating from it in several directions.
156. Page 167
157. FINDING YOUR PULSE
158. The easiest connection you’ll ever experience is probably a cross-platform connection in a major rail transit network.
159. What’s more, since the trains dwell while it happens, and both leave to gether, the delay due to the connection is zero.
160. This event, called a pulse, is a way ofproviding fast connections even among services that aren’t very frequent (figure 13-1).
161. ![[Pasted image 20220531105422.png]]

163.  Page 168
164. That, in turn, increases the risk that a bus won’t get back to the pulse point in time to make the connection, leaving people stranded.
165. Pulse networks can become quite sophisticated.
166. Of course, there’s nothing about pulsing that’s specific to buses. Trains, trams, and ferries can all be scheduled to pulse.
167. Page 170
168. HIGH-FREQUENCY CONNECTIONS: FROM PULSES TO GRIDS
169. If our services are running in mixed traffic, either as buses or street cars, probably not. Even in uncongested traffic conditions, and with perfectly skilled operations, actual travel time in mixed traffic varies over a range of 5 minutes or so.
170. On the other hand, fully separated (class A) services have fewer causes of delay and can therefore keep to a more precise schedule. For this reason, they may find benefit in pulsing every 10 minutes, as many major subway systems do at key stations.
171. The better our frequency, the less crucial it is to pulse. If we can improve frequencies to the point where no pulses are needed, we’re ready to discover one of the most beautiful geometric forms in the transit business: the grid.
172. Page 171
173. THE JOY OF GRIDS
174. Page 173
175. Obviously, the grid is adjusted to follow the street network, but more importantly, the network balances two kinds of grid 
		- Rectangular. A grid pattern of parallel north-south and east-west lines, running continuously all the way across the dense area. Rectangular grids are ideal for large areas of continuous density with many scattered activity centers.
		- Spiderweb. A grid consisting of lines radiating from the central business district and circular lines orbiting it. The radiating lines are called radials, while the circular lines are called orbitals or crosstowns. Spiderwebs make sense where you have a single, overwhelmingly dominant center of demand.
176. Page 174
177. If you study your favorite high-frequency, big-city transit system, you’ll probably find that the structure is a hybrid between the rectangular and spiderweb grid types. Often the larger structure looks like a spiderweb, but if you focus on the densest area, you’ll see lines functioning as a grid.
178. Page 175
179. You would have fewer options for how to complete a trip with a single connection.
180. So, to sum up:
	- Grids arise from the ambition to connect any two points in a city with good transit service, rather than selecting “preferred” destinations as radial and pulse networks must do.
	- Page 176
	- Grids require high frequency because you can’t time every connection in a grid pattern. If you don’t have high frequency (generally every 15 minutes or better), it doesn’t matter if your routes are in a grid pattern. It still isn’t a grid network.
	- To provide the most direct path between literally any two points, the optimal grid is usually the rectangular grid. However . . .
	- Most cities do have some high-demand destinations where lines should converge to the extent possible, such as downtown. So, to the extent that your network needs to do that, it may logically evolve elements of a spiderweb grid,
181. Page 177
182. Geometrically required connections are the ones we’ve been discussing up to now, where the connection is required by a network that delivers frequency and simplicity for a many-to-many network. These are connections that can’t be avoided in a network designed for maximum ridership in a high-density area. They include:
	- Changing direction within a grid, such as the L-shaped trip that a rectangular grid requires.
	- Connecting between lines in a network organized around pulses.
	- Connecting between services of dramatically different speed, such as between rapid transit (such as a subway, monorail, commuter rail, or busway) and a local service, or between airplanes and trains.
183. Politically required connections usually occur at government boundaries, where you must connect from one agency’s service to another even to continue the same general direction at the same general speed.
184. Page 178
185. Technologically required connections occur because you have to change from one kind of transit vehicle to another, even to continue in the same general direction at the same general speed.
186. Page 179
187. If you want to serve a complex and diverse city with many destinations and you value frequency and simplicity, the geometry of public transit will force you to require connections. That means that for any trip from point A to point B, the quality of the experience depends on the design of not just A and B but also of a third location, point C, where the required connection occurs.
188. At this connection point—point C—several things must happen that typically seem to be in conflict:
	- Large volumes of time-sensitive transit service pass through, often including both rapid transit and local transit lines needing to connect with the rapid transit and with one another.
	- Some transit services may terminate, which may require storage for vehicles and break facilities for drivers.
	- A single location is provided with especially direct transit access to many other locations, due to the services converging there for the connection. This location may enjoy dramatically better transit mobility than anywhere else nearby, so it becomes a logical point to locate for people or institutions that value such mobility.
189. The third point is the biggest: connection points are the logical places to make big investments in transit-oriented development.
190. Such development is also welcome from a transit perspective, because the more residents, jobs, and activities are at the connection point, the more potential riders the agency has.
191. Page 180
192. But when many transit services converge on one point, especially on the surface, they need considerable space for their stops and their driver break locations. In the midst of these debates, it’s common to hear someone ask: “Can’t we divide this big transit center into two smaller ones? ...
193. The answer is almost always no. At a connection point that is designed to serve a many-to-many city, people must be able to connect between any service and any other.
194. Page 181
195. One solution (not the only one) is some kind of new urban street that can serve the needs of the transit connection while also being part of an interesting urban center.
196. Page 182
197. To sum up, many great urban design ideas can follow from accepting the needs of connecting transit services into the structure of an urban center. With buses in particular, it’s always tempting to move them out of sight, out by the rubbish bins, which of course sends a signal to their passengers about how unwelcome in the center they are. Good design pushes back against this impulse and instead finds ways to turn the abundance of transit, and the crucial role of transit connections, into a positive feature of the center’s life.
198. Page 183
199. **14 BE ON THE WAY! TRANSIT IMPLICATIONS OF LOCATION CHOICE**
200. As we’ve seen that the quality and cost-effectiveness of transit is deter- s we’ve explored the geometry of transit and the choices it presents, mined by the layout of the community it serves.
201. High quality and cost-effective transit implies certain geometric patterns. To the extent that those patterns work with the design of your community, you can have transit that’s both high-quality and cost-effective. To the extent that they don’t, you can’t.
202. Page 184
203. Communities can and sometimes do run extensive local transit systems that achieve low ridership for the public cost, and they decide that this is worthwhile.Your low-density, car-oriented suburb can also have very cost-effective transit that doesn’t serve most residents.
204. So once you’ve built a community in a form that’s unfriendly to transit, or chosen to live in one, you will face a hard question: quality transit for everyone or cost-effective transit?
205. There will be no getting around it. Decades of innovation have not found a way to serve transit-unfriendly suburbs with the same quality and cost-effectiveness that’s easily achieved in transit-friendly ones. In fact, technology is certain not to solve the problem, because the problem is one of geometry.
206. Page 186
207. A FEW ASSUMPTIONS
208. In proposing this principle, I am making a few assumptions about the future:
	- Urban civilization will continue. I assume that while the next few decades will be full of surprises, they will not see the collapse of urban civilization.
	- Transit in the developed world will continue to be expensive to provide. The cost of transit in wealthy countries is mostly the cost of operations, and except for driverless metros, these will continue to be dominated by the cost of labor.
	- Cost-effectiveness will still matter. I assume that decisions about public transit will continue to be made in the context of some limit on what can be spent.
	- Ridership will still matter. Cost-effectiveness, of course, can be calculated for any benefit
209. Page 187
210. Ridership goals will therefore still be a leading factor in measuring transit outcomes. For that reason, good transit geography is any geography in which high demand transit destinations are on a direct and operable path between other high-demand transit destinations. A bad geography for transit, then, is one that indulges in cul-de-sacs on a large scale. It sets destinations a little back from the line, so that transit must either bypass them or deviate to them, where deviating means delaying all the other passengers riding through this point (figure 14.1b).
211. Page 190
212. The Shopping Center Setback Most urbanists know what to do about the suburban shopping center, and especially the “big box.”
213. Page 192
214. Fortunately, big boxes are built to last only a couple of decades, so as they wear out they can be redeveloped with the store close to the street and with the parking behind or to one side. The larger regional shopping center is a bigger challenge. In some North American suburban areas, these have taken over many cultural functions, including festivals and exhibits that used to occur in public space.
215. If we want to provide even lifeline access for transit-dependent persons, let alone pursue ridership goals, big regional shopping centers must be connection points, with appropriate facilities to bring local transit service up to the shopping center building.
216. Page 194
217. *The New Suburb*
218. New suburbs continue to be built on the edges of many of our cities. It’s easy for urbanists to dismiss all of them as sprawl—a uniform, thinly spread evil. But these suburbs can take many forms, including some that have the potential to support good transit into the future. In fact, without changing the overall mix of densities, you can sometimes rearrange a proposed suburb to produce a much better transit outcome.
219. Page 197
220. What should a developer and architect do when faced with a development parcel in this position in the urban structure? Locate town centers in
221. a logical direct path with several other major destinations, ideally also where there’s a right-of-way that could reasonably be used for transit in the future.
222. Page 207
223. ... many destinations along something that feels like a straight line. One particularly tricky thing transit needs to do is pass through major destinations (downtowns, campuses, medical centers, and other activity centers) in the middle of the line without being slowed down so much that longer trips through those points no longer find the service useful.
224. But if our rapid transit is on the surface, we often face a conflict between the speed and reliability of rapid transit and the urban designer’s impulse to slow everything down to create a pedestrian-friendly environment. This is a persistent challenge in the design of light rail and surface bus systems.
225. Page 209
226. ... apartments have often been built close to these intersections. So while the pedestrian environment is often dreadful, the development pattern—a mixture of commercial and dense residential—is actually quite good for transit. What’s needed, then, is a process of (a) creating the pedestrian links and crossings required to make walking to transit safe, and (b) ensuring that the transit service is fast and reliable, unimpeded by car traffic.
227. The goal would be not to turn suburban development into a lattice of pleasant town centers but, rather, to make it incrementally more humane, safe, and functional on its own terms, by gradually welcoming transit and the pedestrian.
228. Page 211
229. So, to turn a typical suburban boulevard into a place where transit can really succeed, we would need to:
	- Ensure that transit will not be impeded by car traffic congestion, through a range of tools, including full transit lanes where needed.
	- Put transit stops at a wide but walkable spacing—perhaps a quarter mile (400 m)—and make them permanent.
	- Require a safe way to cross the boulevard at every bus stop, as a necessary condition for a stop, because you can’t use a stop to make a round trip on transit unless you can cross the street there.
	- Look for a way to meet other pedestrian access needs with the same signals or crossing protections that the previous point requires.
	- Ensure that sidewalks along the boulevard are adequate, including appropriate buffering if the boulevard is fast.
230. If we add too many design requirements that are derived from urbanist ideals, we can quickly lose focus on the reality of what the street is today and the level of improvement that’s needed to achieve basic safety and functionality for transit, walking, and cycling.
231. Page 213
232. The fact is, we’ve already built most of our cities, and what we’ve usually built is a pattern where density and commercial activity tend to cluster along straight, fast boulevards. All we need is the necessary priority, so that congestion can’t undermine transit.
233. Page 217
234. **16 TAKE THE LONG VIEW**
235. As we’ve seen, the potential for transit in your city will be determined largely by the pattern of development. If you really want to coordinate transit and land use planning for your whole city, you need to do a long-range plan, looking about twenty years in the future.
236. Page 218
237. The purpose of long-range transit planning is not just to create a list of projects to be built but, rather, to sketch the network structure of the future, showing how it will work as a network and how it will work with the expected shape of the city. So, a long-range plan must be specific about where the Frequent Network will be, so that land use and other infrastructure planning can be done with it in mind.
238. Steer away from technology debates.
239. Page 219
240. Now here’s the catch: a good long-range transit plan must be a two-way conversation with long-term land use planning. Now and then, you’ll hear arguments that development should lead and transport should follow, but those are pointless chicken-egg debates. The process is a conversation, and in a productive conversation that leads to consensus, nobody cares who made the first move. Long-term land use planning (called “comprehensive planning” in the United States) typically goes first, because it deals with a more diverse range of issues, but if for some reason that isn’t happening in your city, the transit plan can take the lead.
241. Page 222
242. the long-range planning process must dance with the short range process.
243. Page 223
244. short-term actions that proceed in the direction of the long-range plan can be a boost for confidence. Most successful public transport authorities, and the cities they serve, have a pretty clear picture of where they are likely to develop Frequent Network lines into the future.
245. Page 225
246. That reality tends to support the first choice on all four of the plumber’s questions listed above. These transit intensive cities
	• have high ridership because Ridership goals, rather than Coverage goals, seem to be their intention. Indeed, without very high ridership, the cities wouldn’t function.
	• have connective systems, relying on people to get off of one bus or train and onto another. These systems are usually based on very high frequency. They have relatively high legibility as a result, and this legibility is critical to the sensation that you can move about the city freely without facing time-consuming learning curves for each trip.
	• are focused on all-day travel, not just the peak. Their transit gets more crowded on the peak, and the trains and buses become more frequent, but the basic pattern of the transit network is there all day and well into the evening, seven days a week.
	• have extensive segments of exclusive right-of-way, not just in their rail networks but usually also in on-street transit lanes for buses or railor both.
247. Page 227
248. But all transit technologies obey the same geometric laws. You can ignore these laws as you chase an exciting technology, but they will still be there in the end, determining the actual usefulness of your service. If we want people to embrace transit as a primary mode of travel, transit service must be useful.
