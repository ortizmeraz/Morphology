```ad-abstract
The idea that accessibility is the true goal for transportation planning goes back many decades, starting with notable writings in the 1950s, followed by a flurry of writings in the 1970s. Since then considerable academic work has gone into the development of accessibility measures, but their use in transportation planning is not yet pervasive. In this essay, I reflect on why progress toward the wholesale adoption of an accessibility-oriented approach in planning practice has been slow, review some of the promising efforts in recent years that suggest that transportation planning may be on the cusp of an accessibility era, and offer thoughts about the power of the accessibility concept as a framework for thinking about the urban environment.

## Bullet points
1. Page 1
2. accessibility is defined as the potential of opportunities for interaction.
3. a measure of the intensity of the possibility of interaction
4. the concept of accessibility: here was a way to think about my two questions, to understand and indeed measure the relationships between transportation investments and land development as they affect daily human life.
5. the level of accessibility from a given place reflects the distribution of destinations around it, the ease with which those destinations can be reached by various modes, and the amount and character of the activity found there. It tells us something about the choices that the built environment offers to travelers.
6. accessibility provides the most appropriate framework for characterizing the built environment when studying travel behavior (Handy, 2018),

8. The idea that accessibility is the true goal for transportation planning goes back many decades, long before I latched onto it. Lewis Mumford articulated this idea in a series of essays in the New Yorker in the 1950s (Mumford, 1955; Mumford, 1963).
9. Planners and geographers produced a flurry of writings about accessibility in the 1970s. But if accessibility is such an important concept, more than a decade later, so little evidence of its use in practice and so much frustration on the part of practitioners who believed in its importance?
10. The first challenge is that what is meant by “accessibility” is not always clear. To begin with, the term “accessibility” has other important transportation-related meanings, in particular the concept of “universal accessibility” having to do with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
11. But most conversations about accessibility in the broader sense necessarily start with a clarification that the topic is not specifically about ADA-related accessibility.
12. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the term “accessibility” is often used together with the term “mobility,” with no effort to define or distinguish the two terms.
13. The concepts are, of course, related, in that good mobility contributes to good accessibility, but good mobility is not the only way to achieve good accessibility, and prioritizing mobility (e.g. by building freeways) often produces secondary effects that negate any initial increases in accessibility. By failing to distinguish the concepts, policy makers forgo an opportunity to explore new
14. **solutions to our transportation problems**.
15. accessibility measures are simply more difficult than mobility measures. Level-of service, for example, boils down to the simple idea of vehicle delay, though the measures are in fact based on complicated calculations. Accessibility, because it encompasses both ease of travel (or lack thereof) and the availability of destination and their attractiveness, is inherently more complex. The simplest, easiest-to-understand accessibility measures (e.g. cumulative opportunities measures) have been criticized by academics as lacking a sound theoretical foundation; the more theoretically-sound measures (e.g. log-sum measures) are more complex to calculate and may be more difficult to explain to the public (Geurs and van Wee, 2004;  Miller, 2018).
16. advances in academia do not necessarily translate into advances in practice.
17. Led by Cecilia Silva and Luca Bertolini, The first part of the project focused on developing and delivering accessibility instruments for use by practitioners. The second part involved assessments by practitioners of the useful of these instruments as well as case studies of their use in practice. The findings highlight how hard the shift to an accessibility approach can be: the speed with which practitioners grasped the concept of accessibility varied considerably; practitioners saw the accessibility instruments as “complex, inflexible, incomprehensible black boxes” (te Brömmelstroet et al., 2014: 4).

19. The federal requirements for performance-based planning, adopted with the passage of MAP-21 in 2012, mean that MPOs that have adopted accessibility goals must develop concomitant performance measures. The emergence of commercially-available packages that provide data and algorithms for producing accessibility measures is making the job far easier for MPOs. Several efforts to bring the work of academics to practice are also helping.
20. Simply having measures is important, not only because of performance-management requirements but also because “what gets measured gets done” and all that.
21. Having standardized measures is important for ensuring that we’re all talking about the same thing. There is no one right way and arguably many appropriate ways to measure accessibility depending on the purpose of the analysis.
22. Given the plethora of possibilities, settling on a standard way of measuring accessibility would be helpful for planning agencies. Indeed, it may be an essential step in shifting transportation planning practice away from its mobility focus and toward an accessibility-oriented approach.
23. Accessibility is its vast potential as a way to understand the urban environment. Using the concept of accessibility as a way to simply think about the urban environment can itself be helpful to planners. And accessibility doesn’t have to be any harder to grasp as a concept than vehicle delay.
24. **city of shortdistances**
25. Often used as a synonym for “compact city,” the concept evokes a place where destinations are within short distances from homes, making walking or biking a real possibility. In such cities, accessibility is  proximity rather than mobility.
26.  are also especially effective at combining good accessibility within the neighborhood with good accessibility to regional centers. For needs that cannot be met within a short distance, residents can avail themselves of an integrated network of bus, streetcar, and metro systems that link their neighborhood to the city center and other parts of the region.
27. They have good accessibility at the regional scale without having to drive.

29. Transportation planning in the U.S. has for decades focused on moving more cars more quickly a mobility-oriented approach that provided good regional–accessibility cities neglected the local accessibility that could compensate for reduced regional accessibility, limited progress in providing regional accessibility by modes other than driving.
30.  mobility-oriented approach, U.S. cities are increasingly turning to policies to promote higher densities and closer proximity to activitiesto–enhance local accessibility speed-dependent (i.e. regional) accessibility and proximity-dependent (i.e. local) accessibility,
31. As long as such places offer “congestion-adaptive travelchoices”such as walking and transit, the net effect of agglomerations for accessibility can be positive.“
32. ...academics have been advocating for a shift from the mobility-oriented approach that has long dominated transportation planning in the U.S. to an accessibility-oriented approach that could reduce environmental impacts while improving quality of life growing severity of congestion coupled with the growing concern over climate change may finally foster the political will needed to usher in the accessibility era in transportation planning.
