Accessibility to transit facilities is a factor thought to influence the level of usage of services. Past examinations of accessibility to transit have considered the built environment and levels of service of transit. In contrast, accessibility by transit has received more limited attention in transit mode share analysis. The objective of this paper is to investigate the implications of accessibility to transit and by transit for mode shares in the city of Hamilton, Canada. We model transit shares by means of a logistic regression that takes into account over-dispersion and spatial autocorrelation. The results of the final model indicate that accessibility by transit is a significant predictor of modal share in our case study. Technically, our analysis clearly illustrates that ignoring over-dispersion and autocorrelation can result in misleading inference and erroneous policy prescriptions.

2. Transit systems play an important role in urban public policy.
3. They are increasingly seen as an essential element in policy packages that aim to reduce congestion, make more efficient use of road space, reduce pollution, and keep the lid on increasing energy consumption in the transportation sector (May et al., 2000). As such, they appear to be key to achieve overall environmental, economic, and social sustainability objectives. Despite their potential contributions to urban policy objectives, transit systems are not widely used by the public.
4. The objective of this paper is to investigate the implications of accessibility to transit and by transit for mode shares in the city of Hamilton, Canada.
5. Accessibility denotes the ease with which a given destination can be reached from an original location using a particular form of mobility (Handy and Niemeier, 1997). Accessibility totransit facilities has been explored in the past. This includes examinations of the density, diversity, and design of built environments, as well as transit levels of service (Cervero and Kockelman, 1997; Estupiñán and Rodriguez, 2008; O’Sullivan and Morrall, 1997; Rodriguez et al., 2009). An additional factor that to our knowledge remains to be more fully explored in the literature on transit patronage and modal shares is accessibility by transit.
6. Of particular interest for this research are the effects of accessibility to transit, and accessibility by transit, defined as the number of jobs that can be reached using HSR services.

8. This paper makes the following contributions. Firstly, we calculate ‘accessibility by transit’ using a geographical information system; this variable is introduced as an explanatory factor in logistic regression models of modal share.
9. Besides accessibility to transit, a key focus interest for this research is accessibility by transit, defined as the number of jobs within a determined time frame that can be accessed by transit.
10. Transit-based accessibility has been compared to accessibility by car in other research, including Blumenberg and Ong (2001), Shen (2001), Hess (2005), Kawabata and Shen (2006, 2007), Kawabata (2009), and Benenson et al. (2010).
11. Our results suggest that estimating an over-dispersion parameter alleviates to some extent the inflation of the variance, but that resolving the autocorrelation situation leads to even sharper inference. This, we argue, has important implications for model-based policy prescriptions. On the other hand, accessibility by transit as a factor that influences transit ridership and shares has only recently begun to receive attention. The measures of accessibility by transit employed in these studies are fairly aggregated, since they consider city-wide employment or at best central versus decentralized jobs. However, some part of the city might not be connected by the transit service of the city and those areas must be excluded when calculating the accessibility by transit in terms of number of jobs in the areas.
12. In addition to these factors, a topic of current interest in the literature is the association between accessibility to transit services and use of transit.
13. It is thus important to refine the way accessibility by transit is calculated, by considering the number of jobs that can be reached within the duration of a typical trip conducted on the transit network.
14. Transit ridership varies significantly across urban areas in Canada. In large urban areas the proportion of commuter by transit tends to be higher. Approximately 20% of workers in Canada’s six largest metropolitan areas used the bus or subway for part or all of their commute in 1992 and 2005 (Statistics Canada, 2006).
15. Accessibility to transit is enhanced by design factors, such as the presence of sidewalks, sidewalk width, sidewalk density, street density, and intersection density (e.g. Cervero and Kockelman, 1997; Cervero et al., 2009b; Guo, 2009; Hess et al., 1999; Kitamura et al., 1997; Rodriguez and Joo, 2004).

17. Data for this study were collected from different sources. For land use information, the Hamilton parcel map for 2009 was obtained from the GIS Planning and Analysis Section, Planning and Economic Development Department, City of Hamilton. Other built environment information such as number of street intersection, length of streets, length of sidewalk, and square footage of buildings have been provided by the GIS Services, Information Technology Services, City of Hamilton. Transit information was collected from the Hamilton Street Railway (HSR). The Hamilton Street Railway Company (HSR) is the Transit Division of the City of Hamilton, Public Works Department.
18. Built environment variables were processed based on the above sources, using a Geographic Information System to extract the built environment variables at the DA level. For calculating the variable ‘square footage to parcel ratio’, parcels with no structure i.e. parcels with zero square footage have been excluded. All built environment variables have been defined as densities or counts.

20. **Results and discussion**
21. Spatial filtering, since it is based on conventional estimation routines once that the eigenvector analysis has been completed, can be easily implemented in commercial statistical packages.
22. Here, we compare a suite of models that: (1) ignore over-dispersion and autocorrelation; (2) estimate the over-dispersion parameter without the spatial filter; and (3) jointly estimate a dispersion parameter and use spatial filtering to control for autocorrelation.

24. Modeling aggregated transit shares is an important element to plan services. A focus of previous research has been on accessibility to transit as an explicative factor of mode shares. In this paper, we argued that accessibility by transit is a factor in need of more attention.
25. This study illustrates the use of eigenvector-based spatial filtering to deal with autocorrelation in non-normal models, and demonstrates the effect of autocorrelation and over-dispersion in the logistic model.
26. In our case study, the spatial filter was composed of a linear combination of 14 eigenvectors to capture moderate-to-strong positive spatial autocorrelation. With regards to the variable ‘accessibility by transit’, our finding is that it contributes positively to usage of transit.
27. The model also confirms previous findings regarding mode share of transit. Dwelling density is important for increasing the mode share of transit. This is the only built environment variable which is significant after applying the spatial filtering approach. Frequency of transit service also can help to increase transit mode share, when considering the overall levels of service in neighboring DAs.
