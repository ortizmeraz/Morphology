```ad-abstract
Social equity is increasingly becoming an important objective in transport planning and project valuation. This paper provides a framework and an empirical investigation in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) examining the links between public transit accessibility and the risks of social exclusion, simply understood as the suppressed ability to conduct daily activities at normal levels. Specifically, we use a large-sample travel survey to present a new transport-geography concept termed participation deserts, neighbourhood-level clusters of lower than expected activity participation. We then use multivariate models to estimate where, and for whom, improvements in transit accessibility will effectively increase activity participation and reduce risks of transport-related social exclusion. Our results show that neighbourhoods with high concentrations of low-income and zero-car households located outside of major transit corridors are the most sensitive to having improvements in accessibility increase daily activity participation rates. We contend that transit investments providing better connections to these neighbourhoods would have the greatest benefit in terms of alleviating existing inequalities and reducing the risks of social exclusion. The ability for transport investments to liberate suppressed activity participation is not currently being predicted or valued in existing transport evaluation methodologies, but there is great potential in doing so in order to capture the social equity benefits associated with increasing transit accessibility.

2. A basic function of urban transportation is to enable participation in daily activities
3. In this paper, we argue for the importance incorporating social equity into transport planning because of the relationship between accessibility, the ease of reaching daily activity destinations, and the risks of social exclusion, which can be understood as the suppressed ability to conduct daily activities at normal levels.
4. Specifically, this paper consists of the following four targeted objectives.
5. Page 2
	1. Conduct exploratory spatial analysis to identify participation deserts, clusters of neighbourhoods where residents have low rates of daily activity participation, areas indicative of a risk of transport-related social exclusion.
	2. Visualize and describe the relationships between transit accessibility, socio-economic status (SES), and activity participation.
	3. Further quantify the accessibility-participation relationship through the estimation of activity-generation models in order to investigate the degree to which access to destinations is associated with participation in out-of-home activities. The models consider the non-linear effects of accessibility and are also stratified in order to focus specifically on the effects for low-income and zero-car households.
	4. Use these models to estimate future gains in activity participation stemming from improvements in transit accessibility, and then map where gains in activity participation are most likely to occur in order to aid planning recommendations.
7. in Toronto’s inner-suburbs,...without high levels of transit access. ....This relationship is strongest in low-income and zero-car households. Overall, this shows that improving transit accessibility, either through investments in public transit or intensification of land use, can increase activity participation in currently under-served and socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods.
8. For most of the 20th century, North American transport planning was parochially focused on improving travel speeds and vehicle throughput (McNally, 2000; Meyer and Miller, 2001).
9. Rising concern regarding climate change and environmental degradation has led to transport research and practice incorporating environmental indicators into modelling scenarios and project evaluations. However, to date, there has been much less consideration given to social equity in transport planning, despite social outcomes being widely cited as one of the three pillars for sustainable development (along with economic growth and environmental preservation) (Feitelson, 2002; Martens, 2006; Ciommo and Shiftan, 2017).
10. Social equity generally refers to the fairness of how the costs and benefits of a resource, such as transport, are distributed among a group of people (Pereira et al., 2017; Litman, 2019).
11. With regards to transport specifically, it is unreasonable to expect equal levels of opportunity or outcome across space or by population groups.
12. The distribution of transportation networks and land-use in a region cannot be spatially uniform and will never result in equal levels of individual ability to access transport services or different types of activity destinations.
13. Whilesome levels of inequality are expected, major barriers to travel can limit people in their ability to participate in daily activities, and for some, can cause transport-related social exclusion (Lucas, 2012; Martens, 2016). Social exclusion can occur when people are obstructed from participating in activities which are important for their livelihood and well-being; and reducing risks of social exclusion is often cited as a key component for producing a fairer society (Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Churchill and Smyth, 2019).
14. ...number of researchers have discussed how reducing the risks of social exclusion, and greater considerations of social equity more generally, should increasingly be incorporated into transport planning practice (e.g. Karner and Niemeier, 2013; Manaugh et al., 2015). Proponents have argued for policy which reduces vulnerability to transport poverty, minimizing wide-ranging in equalities in transport accessibility, and increasing overall levels of transport accessibility of a region (e.g. Garrett and Taylor, 1999; Martens, 2016; Pereira et al., 2017).
15. Martens (2016), in particular, argues for more in-depth understanding the relationship between accessibility and activity participation to define sufficient levels of accessibility which limit transport-related social exclusion.
16. **Accessibility & activity participation**
17. Activity participation rates have been considered as a key equity variable and have been highlighted as an important outcome metric that should be analyzed during transport project evaluations (Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Litman, 2017; Martens, 2006; Martens, 2016). While some variability in participation is inevitable, high spatial concentrations of particularly low levels of activity participation can indicate the presence of transport barriers to accessing activity destinations.

19. Accessibility is often measured by researchers to assess the distributional benefits and effects of urban transport systems.
20. Outside of the transport-equity literature, some previous empirical research has linked measures of accessibility with trip and/or activity generation rates. Results have been mixed. Some have shown that measures of accessibility are associated with increased trip making and activity participation (Vickerman, 1974; Koenig, 1980; Thill and Kim, 2005; Fransen et al., 2018),
21. As well, the mathematical relationship between accessibility and activity participation is under-studied. However, knowing the shape of this relationship (e.g. see Fig. 1) is critical for evaluating whether, where, and to what extent, accessibility improvements will have different effects towards increasing activity participation. Most previous empirical research has assumed a linear relationship between accessibility and activity participation (e.g. Cordera et al., 2017).

23. **Our study** is situated in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA),.... lower-income households try to locate in neighbourhoods with good transit...access, likely partly due to limited car ownership. As well, many of the densest apartment neighbourhoods that attract lower-income households tend to be located centrally or on major arterials with high levels of transit service compared to the locations of less affordable single-detached homes.
24. This suggests that higher income households are more likely to buy or lease a car when residing in areas of lower transit access to overcome this lack of alternative mobility options; while lower-income households are often not able to afford to do so. It also shows that wealthier households who choose not to own a vehicle, are able overcome this mobility barrier by paying to live in high accessibility neighbourhoods.
25. ... many individuals with high levels of activity participation tend to live in low-access parts of the city, presumably achieving these high rates through automobile use. Even among low-income households, accessibility and activity participation are not closely related. 66% of trips by individuals in low income households are made by car. For zero-car households, there is a positive relationship between transit accessibility and activity participation.

27. **Our study included** exploratory spatial analysis to identify participation deserts, clusters of neighbourhoods where residents have lower than expected rates of daily activity participation. We find that these areas of low activity participation tend to concentrate in the automobile oriented inner-suburbs; poorer, post-war neighbourhoods where existing levels of transit service are not meeting the needs of residents.
28. Overall, the greatest potential for participation benefits due to transit investments exists in the centre and inner-ring suburbs.

30. **Study limitations & directions for future work**
31. A focus of this research was on transit accessibility and it’s effects on activity generation. Despite this, we did not compute accessibility in the multitude of ways it has been quantified in the literature (e.g. Geurs and Van Wee, 2004; El-Geneidy and Levinson, 2006). We used a single gravity-based access to jobs measure to model activity generation. In general, there are high levels of correlation between different formulations of place-based accessibility (Kwan, 1998; Stkepniak et al., 2019). But in the future, it might be better to use different types of destinations to predict generation of different types of activities (e.g. use measures of transit access to retail to examine its effects on shopping trips). Moreover, participation in discretionary activities may be better modelled using space-time accessibility measures, rather than the place-based measures employed in our study (Fransen et al., 2018).
32. The cross-sectional design of our study also limits our ability to conclude about causal relations, and brings into question the validity of our method for calculating effect sizes.
