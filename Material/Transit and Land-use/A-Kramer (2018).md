```ad-abstract
This paper presents an empirical analysis of seventeen large American and Canadian metropolitan regions to look at geographies of affordability in transportation and housing. A pre-recession snapshot of frequent transit networks are mapped against housing cost, urban form and socioeconomic variables from census data, and the relationship of housing cost to transit access is tested visually, by descriptive statistics, and with logistic regression. The results show apparent contradictions: while there is great variance in transit access and housing cost between and across cities, transitscapes are consistently more racially diverse, higher density, and poorer than surrounding autoscapes; but, once income and racialization are held constant, there is a decreasing chance of access to transit as housing prices become more affordable. In other words, for many people, there is no affordable access. These paradoxes are interpreted with relevance to patterns of racial and economic geographies of land use and mobility, the dominance of postwar automobility, the suburbanization of poverty, and wealth inequality in North American cities. This research fills gaps in the transit-oriented urban form research, by pointing to the need to consider housing affordability; it also fills gaps in the transit-oriented gentrification research, by opening consideration to all types of transit, not just rail. The results can be compared to relationships of housing affordability and transit in other cities across the world, as there are important commonalities and differences in geographies of poverty and access. While American and Canadian cities are becoming more like international cities in the peripheralization of affordable housing and the mismatch between transit and lower income areas, North American autoscapes face unique challenges to extending public transit access to these peripheries. Understanding and attending to these inequalities of access to housing and transportation can better inform efforts of sustainable transformation through significant mode shift and affordable urban form intensification.

2. neoliberal turn towards disinvestment in public infrastructures and downloading of responsibilities to local governments. This pattern of urban poverty is relatively unique globally, a particularly North American paradox of centralized marginalization.
3. In the twentieth century, cars dominated the newer built environment, together with the single familyhouse, in patterns of secessionist automobility (Henderson, 2006), leaving behind a frayed but walkable urban core networked by buses and trains, and built with older, more compact, higher density housing.
4. As the century turned, we have seen more wealth and investment flowing back into cities. Concurrently, there have been trends towards the suburbanization of poverty (Lee & Leigh, 2007), pushing people to peripheries and away from transit and other urban benefits, such as rental housing stock, fine-grained street networks and mixed uses that allowed walkable access.
5. Through efforts of urban populations, those left behind or newly arrived (arrival city immigrants), artists and community activists, these urban cores or ‘transitscapes’ persisted,

7. Others have questioned the extent of re-urbanization, and the displacement effects of gentrification, pointing to evidence that most people continue to live in suburbs, and that the urban poor are not always geographically displaced as housing costs rise in cities.
8. By showing a snapshot of patterns in time, it doesn't speak to the directionality of change, trends or transitions.
9. The question is – where are cities at with regards to housing affordability near transit? This research uses a pre-recession snapshot in time of metropolitan regions to map transitscapes (frequent transit networks) and to explore their characteristics, both of the people who live within them and also the built environment and housing costs, compared with the autoscapes - areas outside of transit.
10. This research is ambitious in attempting to relate the concerns of a number of different disciplines and fields to each other,
11. These include research on transit ridership, socioeconomics, and built form; geographies of poverty and racialization in North American cities; and research on transit-oriented gentrification and the suburbanization of poverty.
12. Using census data and public transit schedules, I do three things in each city, with complex and paradoxical results: I map frequent transit networks against areas with lower-cost housing and lower income. Transit networks differ between and within cities, from minimal to robust, as does the location of poor neighborhoods, from central to peripheral. As a result, lower-income, lower-cost areas fall on a spectrum from well connected to unconnected by transit.
13. I statistically describe the characteristics of ‘transitscapes’, the areas within walking distance to transit, using variables of income, racialization, housing type, tenure and cost, residential density, household size, and mode share. I find that transitscapes contain and span great diversity and difference.
14. In many places, transit networks function as a kind of transportation social safety net, serving those who are left behind by automobility and its transformative disciplining of space (Kenworthy & Laube, 1999; Urry, 2004; Freund & Martin, 2007). It is a less convenient, less reliable, and slower method of getting around for people who can't afford to drive, an unequal ‘mobility regime’ in the context of car dominance (Sheller, 2015).
15. I model the likelihood of access to transit by housing cost, while controlling for the other variables using logistic regression. As the value of homes rise, the likelihood of access to transit rises too.
16. This speaks to a problem of housing affordability in relation to transit access.
17. The focus in this literature has been on how characteristics of the built environment – particularly density, land use mix, and street grids – are related to transit ridership. These ideas are ubiquitous in American and Canadian land use and transportation planning, specifically through ideas of transit-oriented development (Filion, Kramer, & Sands, 2016).
18. Low income households make fewer and shorter trips, suggesting suppressed demand (Handy, 2006). In a synthesis of 50 empirical studies, mode choice is found to be primarily a function of socioeconomics and secondarily a function of the built environment (Ewing & Cervero, 2001).
19. In a review of transit ridership data in American cities, Brian Taylor has documented a strong link between racialization, income, gender and bus ridership, and also found that transportation plans don't focus on addressing these markets and demand, but rather tend to invest in rail projects with less ridership potential (Garrett & Taylor, 1999; Taylor & Morris, 2015).1
20. Recently, Susan Handy has followed others in calling for an accessibility-focused approach to the land use transportation question, which takes into account the number of opportunities (destinations) available to a person and the cost of getting there (Handy, 2018).

22. Transitscapes: areas within walking distance to transit
23. The geographic center of each block group or dissemination area was mapped to see if it fell within 500 m (around 1/3 of a mile) of a local route or 1 k (2/3 mile) of a rapid transit station. Generally in transit planning, walkable distance is considered to be 400 m for local routes, which have stops closely spaced and are slower, and 800 m for rapid transit stations such as subway or surface rail, because people will walk farther for faster service. I added a little extra to this buffer because research has shown that people are also willing to walk farther where there is an interesting urban milieu (Canepa, 2007), and people without cars will of necessity walk farther to catch transit. Although walkable distance to frequent transit this is a relatively simple proxy of transit access, as it doesn't include destination density or travel time, it is effective for comparing across many cities. I call these areas within walking distance to frequent transit ‘transitscapes’.
24. Logistic regression model
25. I run a logistic regression model for each city. Using walkable distance to frequent transit as a metric of the ability to access the city through non-automobile means, I hold variables of housing type and household socioeconomics constant to see what the relationship of transit access is to housing cost.3 The model uses neighborhood units (block groups and dissemination areas) as units of analysis. A logistic regression model allows for a binary outcome variable, in this case, walkable distance to the frequent transit network.
26. The independent variables include transit commuting mode share, household income, home value, building age, residential density, housing type, tenure, car ownership,4 and race/ethnicity.

28. The unit of analysis is the block group, and the outcome or dependent variable is access to transit as described above.
29. The outcome variable (access to frequent transit) is a binary, yes or no variable.
30. This method is limited in several ways. It groups individuals and households into neighborhood units, potentially missing diversity within these neighborhoods.
31. Page 8
32. The maps show great variance between transit access and housing cost between and across cities, while the descriptive statistics show transitscapes to be consistently less white, higher density, and poorer than other areas not within walking distance to frequent transit. The logistic regression results hold income, racialization and urban form constant, revealing a decreasing chance of access to transit as housing prices are more affordable.
33. Transitscapes on average were home to more diverse populations, with higher transit use and rates of walking and cycling, more house holds without vehicles, lower household incomes, and a larger variety of housing types and tenures. Autoscapes, conversely, are more dominated by single-family homes, and have populations that are on average wealthier and whiter with fewer zero-car households. While populations with frequent transit access are on average more diverse and with lower incomes than those in car-dependent areas, the cost of housing varies. In some cases, it is more expensive, and in others, less.
34. Taken together, these three findings demonstrate that lower-income households face an affordability paradox in major metropolitan regions, which means that the already imperfect match between housing affordability and transit access is exacerbated by underlying income and racial inequalities. While some of these households may move to suburban locations where home ownership may be more affordable, they are then living in an area where they are dependent on the private automobile for access to the city and the opportunity it offers.
35. The results shed light on the research question. Can people who most need and use transit afford to live near it? Despite the fact that transitscapes have older, denser housing stock, more rental, and are home to more ethnically and racially diverse populations, with lower incomes, the housing does not consistently cost less in these areas.

37. The findings overall speak to an imbalance between housing and transit. By including frequent bus routes, it goes beyond the focus on rail in research on transit-oriented gentrification.
38. This research contributes to comparative international scholarship on geographies of housing affordability and transportation access. In an international context, this mismatch of supply and demand has also been studied, particularly in relation to patterns of the peripheralization, and often racialization, of poverty, and lack of public transit connections to these areas. In Latin American cities, favelas are often located on hillsides around cities, and difficult to access. ...  Another important implication is the challenge of inequality.
39. Housing and transportation affordability are tied to income, and greater income inequality makes affordability more challenging. By describing these geographies of affordability and access in American and Canadian metropolitan regions, this research reveals the challenges and opportunities for significant mode shift and urban form transformation that is needed for more equitable and sustainable cities.
