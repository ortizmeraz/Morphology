```ad-abstract
The paper centres on the content of metropolitan-scale plans of the six largest Canadian urban regions. Plans in all these regions promote intensification and alternatives to automobile use, and thus adhere to smart growth and sustainability principles. In all cases save one, reliance on nodal development is the preferred manner of achieving intensification and ensuring its co-ordination with public transit services. Meanwhile, however, results point to differences in the stage of development of metropolitan planning strategies. The paper concludes by reflecting on the wide adoption of the nodal model in metropolitan plans. It interprets this popularity as the outcome of the ability of nodes to achieve intensification and reduced car reliance objectives, while conforming to prevailing planning and institutional capacity. The effectiveness of the nodal approach and other broad metropolitan planning concepts rests in their capacity to procure a metropolitan structure for the other scales at which urban planning is practised.

## Bullet points

·         The paper is about transformative transport and land use strategies formulated in this context.

·         Page 2

·         Smart growth, which enjoys broad support within the planning community and certain political circles, targets not only the energy and environmental downsides of urban dispersion, but equally its high infrastructure and maintenance costs, as well as its adverse impacts on the economy, health and quality of life (for example, Burchell, 2005; Marshall et al., 2009).

·         The paper concentrates on such strategies present in metropolitan-scale plans of large Canadian urban regions, the six census metropolitan areas with a 2006 population over 1 million.

·         There is rising awareness of the downsides of prevailing urban development, characterised by heavy dependence on the car, relatively low density, rigid functional specialisation and a scattering of structuring activities—hence the term ‘dispersal’ to connote this urban form (Dear and Flusty, 2002; Filion et al., 1999).

·         Dispersed urbanisation has long been criticised for its voracious energy consumption and lack of environmental sustainability (Williams et al., 2000).

·         In an attempt to examine how urban change objectives can be met in these circumstances, the study concentrates on one key step in the planning process: the for mulation of transformative transport and land use strategies. These strategies constitute an intermediary (and essential) stage between smart growth principles and the implementation of planning policies leading to an actual transformation of the city.

·         This planning stage gives urban substance to smart growth principles.

·         The City of Montreal has adopted a transport plan which includes subway extensions, new streetcar and bus rapid transit lines, and a new commuter train line (Montreal, 2008, pp. 17–22).

·         The City of Montreal has a policy to increase its population through residential intensification and the two largest suburbs, Laval and Longueuil, also promote this form of development (Laval, 2004; Longueuil, 2010; Montre´al, 2004, pp.16 and 25).

·         nowhere in the Montreal plans are centres defined (as they are in the other surveyed metropolitan regions) as high-density, multifunctional districts, which are connected to quality public transit (with services that are frequent and rapid) and provide a pedestrian-friendly environment. As a planner from the Agence Metropolitaine des transports (AMT) observed little effort has been made to integrate these land uses into a walking environment and, worse, there is no rail or bus rapid transit connection.

·         It is, of course, legitimate to raise questions about the possible contribution of the nodal model to a return to a more concentrated urban form.

·         We need to evaluate such possibilities against the background of 65 years of mutual adaptation between driving and urban form. The thorough transformation of accessibility patterns by urban highways was accompanied by a quick adjustment of municipal land use planning and development trends to escalating automobile modal shares in a context of flush government budgets, rising private consumption and general appeal of suburbanism.

·         In its effort to intensify the city and abate its dependence on the car, the nodal approach strives to alter the balance between two distinct urban realms—the dispersed and the concentrated realms—in favour of the latter.

·         Page 17

·         The research has shown unanimous support for intensification and reduced dependence on the car in the plans with a metropolitan scope of the six largest Canadian metropolitan regions, a measure of the influence of the smart growth and sustainability message on urban planning.

·         By virtue of their concentrated configuration and high inner synergy potential, nodes are both easier to implement than other approaches to intensification and conducive to self-propelling urban intensification, which explains their prominence in investigated plans relative to other strategies meant to address dispersion.

·         For the nodal model to be effective, however, all levels at which urban planning is practised must contribute to the achievement of nodes that are dense, multifunctional and transit- and walking conducive—and thus to the shift from a dispersed to a multicentric urban structure.

·         Despite these important caveats, nodes come out as better suited than other existing planning formulae to a trade-off between, on the one hand, intensification and reduced automobile dependence objectives and, on the other, prevailing planning capacity; hence the prominence given to the nodal model by plans from large Canadian metropolitan regions.
