2. Constraints are matters that—voluntarily or involuntarily, explicitly or implicitly—set bounds on the daily, weekly, annual, or longer-term decisions that a household makes; they limit the range of opportunities available to any one person and demarcate the frontier that an individual cannot or will not cross. Primary constraints include time (e.g. 24 hours in a day), space (e.g. geography), finances (e.g. income and wealth), and responsibility (e.g. care of children or parents), and can be thought of as representing the four sides of the Diamond of Action.
3. Page 26
4. Time Fixed constraints are structural elements that set hard bounds on the range of decisions that can be made and activities that can be pursued. The most immediate is time: people are inherently constrained by the time available in a day—24 hours (1,440 
5. minutes). Few people travel anywhere near this amount.
6. Geography
7. While behavioral preferences and activity patterns shape the time budget, the distance that can be traversed in that time (geographically) is affected by the available technologies. As the dominant mode in cities has evolved from walking, to the streetcar, to the automobile, the distance that can be covered in the same time period has increased as well. New forms of information and communications technology continue to emerge as forces influencing people’s activities and residential location patterns.
8. Page 27
9. Money
10. Another set of constraints is the financial resources available per individual and household to make travel, residential, and other decisions. Budgetary constraints force households to make trade-offs between home location and overall  transportation costs.29
11. Responsibility
12. Other constraints, however, may not be relaxing in the same manner. Declining house hold size may mean fewer household responsibilities for some; but it also means there are fewer adults to share the responsibilities incurred by the household, and there may be fewer adults per child in many households with the rise of the single-parent family.
13. Page 40
14. Most people consider “access” as measuring how close something is. That is part of it. But doing so also conceptualizes the concept from just one point of view: the residential consumer. There are other points of view. Think of Starbucks, the once small company that was established in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 to sell quality coffee beans. Retailers are searching for potential opportunities for interaction (accessibility) with customers by locating near them. They may be customers arriving by car, when vehicle traffic is a criterion. Maybe it is customers by foot, which explains location within a shopping mall (which may have already predetermined based on auto traffic).
15. Cities, but more generally—sectors that proximate (become near) by location choices—allow people, households, and firms to gain access to each other. Access is the most comprehensive planning performance measure. It is essential to understanding the complex relationship between transport and land use systems. Access has noticeable effects on travel behavior; it can have considerable impacts on home value; it dictates where to both do business and locate business; it relates to everything in between.6
16. Page 41
17. However, two fundamental components pervade all measures. Measures of access begin with an account of the activity component. Planners call this the land use system; it more colloquially goes by the presence of destinations, such as jobs, restaurants, day cares, health care facilities, and households. These destinations, or opportunities, can also be weighted to account for their attractiveness or competition effects in relation to each other (e.g. larger grocery stores sell more varieties, sizes, and amounts of milk than corner stores).
18. Access measures end with an account of the transport component. This is some measure of how easy or difficult it is to move along the network. Most people think of this as distance, maybe time, sometimes money. In popular media, it is conceived of as having to do with congestion.
19. The use of accessibility measures often leads to different conclusions about the same transport and land use situation compared to mobility measures when they are used alone. While the concept of accessibility in formal measurement has been around for more than fifty years, and has been a common element in the goals and objectives of transport plans, its actual adoption in transport planning has been limited until recently.
20. Walkscore, now a unit of real-estate company Redfin, produces a popular index that rates locations based on how many different types of activities people can reach on foot (they also have a Bikescore and Transitscore). This is a type of accessibility measure.
21. Page 42
22. Measuring the Value of a Network
23. This phenomenon, dubbed the “Law of the Network” (and in a computer networking context, Metcalfe’s Law, named for Robert Metcalfe, developer of the Ethernet network ing standard) can be expressed as:
	S = N (N – 1)
	where S = the size of the network (number of markets)
	N = the number of nodes
	(To illustrate: with 2 nodes: S = 2*1 = 2, with 3 nodes: S = 3*2 = 6, with 4 nodes: S = 4*3 =12, etc.)
23. The value of S grows non-linearly as nodes are added to the network, until all nodes are connected. Clearly there is increasing value to the network as it gets larger. This is useful, but incomplete. Not all nodes are equally valuable. Near nodes are more valuable than far away nodes. As Tobler’s Law says: “Everything is related to every thing else, but near things are more related than distant things.”10
24. Page 43
25. The count of “how many jobs can be reached in 30 minutes by transit” is so straight forward that some have said even politicians can understand it and why it is important. Measuring this is a bit more complicated, that’s why transport modelers and GIS specialists are paid big money. First, we need to know where the actual dots are, and which ones are relevant. Not all jobs, grocery stores, schools, museums, or even Starbucks are the same. Second, we need to know the travel time on the network. This varies by mode of travel and by time of day. For transit, the accessibility just before the bus departs is much higher than just after. For driving, congestion ebbs and flows with traffic.
26. Page 44
27. Measuring Accessibility
28. The task of measuring accessibility is similar to that of measuring network size, but requires a slightly more sophisticated approach. Accessibility multiplies origins by destinations, but discounts that number by some function of the cost of connecting them. Walter Hansen’s 1959 article is commonly referenced as the first application of accessibil ity within a context directly applicable to land use modeling. A measure of accessibility to employment (for a given origin i) can be represented as follows:
	$A_{i}=\sum_{j} E_{j} f(C_{ij})$
	$A_{i}$= Accessibility to employment from zone i
	$E_{j}$= Employment at destination j
	$f(C_{ij})$= function of the travel cost (time and money) between i and j. The higher the cost, the less the weight given to the employment location.
29. Page 45
30. Measuring Person-weighted Accessibility
31. One can compute an overall accessibility measure comparable to the  network size measure by multiplying the accessibility at each origin by a measure of the importance of each origin, and then summing across all origins, for instance:
	$A=\Sum_{j} W_{i} A_{i}$
	where: $A_{i}$ = overall accessibility for region
	$W_{i}$ = workers living at origin i
32. Accessibility (A) differs from Network Size (S) in that one multiplies each interaction by a function of the travel cost, such that distant interactions have less weight than nearby interactions. It is also common to replace the simple measure, number of nodes, with a slightly more sophisticated measure, number of jobs, to measure employment accessibility (or number of workers to measure labor force accessibility).
33. Page 51
34. Absolute vs. Relative Accessibility
35. Absolute accessibility is the total measure of accessibility within a particular area. A transport improvement increases overall accessibility—analogous to increasing the size of the pie.
36. Relative accessibility is the share of total accessibility associated with a particular place. A new transport facility increases the relative accessibility of those points that can directly use the facility—analogous to increasing the percentage of the pie that a particular slice comprises.
37. All infrastructure investments create winners and losers, especially when cities are competing with one another to “keep up with the Joneses.” In largely zero-sum games (for instance, where to hold conventions, or where to build housing), relative accessibility losses translate into absolute economic losses.
38. Page 143
39. The relationship between jobs and workers is central in the urban and regional economics literature, though that literature is still far from reaching a consensus on which came first. Do people follow newly created jobs into regions, or do jobs follow newly arrived migrants? The primary reason the debate has not been settled lies in the endogeneity of both workers and employment.
40. Page 145
41. Community development corporations, in large part, aim to enhance the skill set of their communities and, in turn, attract additional employment opportunities. In both cases, the implicit assumption is that neighborhood residents will work close to home.
42. Policies to encourage local job–worker balance rely on the assumption that doing so will serve to reduce the amount of daily travel required by individuals, thus tempering road congestion and environmental degradation. The issue of choice is often framed in terms of the question of job–worker (or job–housing) balance. In its simplest version, the idea is to identify specific areas (i.e. municipalities), and find the ratio of the number of jobs to the number of workers.
43. Page 147
44. The Central Business District is a business district for a reason; businesses prefer to be nearer to other businesses (customers and suppliers, competitors and complementors) than to their workforce. Just as many firms want to be open for business when others are (giving rise to the eight-to-five workday and the morning and afternoon rush “hours”) to enable temporal coordination, they want to locate near each other to enable spatial coordination.
45. Page 148
46. These frameworks, however, fail to explain the edge cities, suburban activity centers or secondary business districts that have been on the rise since at least the deployment of freeways. (In reality, cities have long been polynucleated, and most are conurbations of earlier urban cores or town centers.) Employment does not only cluster in, around, and near Central Business Districts. This observation suggests that there are additional factors at work in explaining clusters of employment. These factors are often referred to as “agglomeration economies” and have to do with the inter-firm externalities that come as a result of spatial proximity—externalities that come in the form of information spillovers, local non-traded inputs, and a locally skilled labor pool. In addition to such agglomeration effects, however, one must not lose sight of the role of long-standing factors, such as those related to transportation costs, as well as Tiebout’s theories that people “vote with their feet” when choosing where to be live based on “bundles” of amenities, governmental services, and taxes.
47. Page 154
48. To understand the changes in predominant venues for selling goods, one must understand some of the changes in transportation.
49. Although retailers demonstrate many of the same macro-preferences as non-retailers, the way such preferences play out is markedly different.
50. First, retailers directly interact with people as both consumers and suppliers, whereas the businesses considered in Chapter 8 (including the headquarters of retail firms such as Best Buy) conduct transactions primarily with other firms, and deal with people as suppliers (labor). The differences are important. People are interested in many attributes when they (as economists put it) “maximize utility.” Firms, on the other hand, are seemingly simpler actors who “maximize profits.”
51. Second, the size of the transactions most retailers deal with pales in comparison to business-to-business transactions.
52. So for consumers, there are benefits to be found when retailers co-locate, especially when competitors co-locate so that shop pers can compare price and quality, this benefit is large enough to explain the formation of shopping districts, like the satirical Hammock District in the opening quote of this chapter.7

60. Selling Wrap Up
61. The modern marketplace provides consumers considerable flexibility that was unavailable in a convenient fashion just a quarter-century ago. The variety and choice offered by the marketplace allows consumers to undertake a particular activity at several different locations. By extending the hours and days they are open, retail stores accommodate diverse personal schedules. Below, we identify some additional factors affecting commerce:21
	1. Bargain hunting—Competition attracts price-conscious consumers to trade higher travel and time costs for lower cost merchandise. This is particularly the case when consumers are familiar with the goods they seek and are responding to regional advertising. Newspapers still carry advertising inserts describing low-priced goods available only in big-box stores and off-price retailer establishments sited through out a metropolitan region.
	2. Comparison shopping—Although all stores generate some measure of non-local trips, many business activities (e.g. stores selling furniture, major appliances, or automobiles) generate higher levels of longer, “comparison” shopping trips. In these cases, customers will bypass other similar stores to shop there.
	3. Preference for variety—People also travel farther to find variety or a unique shopping experience. For some, shopping is a recreational activity, and “satisfaction” is a large component. Malls that include food courts, multi-screen cinemas, amusement rides, electronic game parlors, concert stages, traveling festivals, and fashion, automobile, hobby, and craft shows play to this preference.
	4. Schedule flexibility—Consumers exhibit considerable flexibility in the time scheduling of trips to retail centers, often made possible by extended store hours. Non-work trips are combined with trips to and from work, and they originate from work sites. Tours involving several non-work activities typically occur after work hours and on weekends. When visiting parts of Europe (Netherlands, Germany), the authors were puzzled how society functioned when households with two working members found stores that closed at the same time as other businesses. When does one shop? (The answer seems to be, when one is supposed to be at work, which may help explain the lower productivity found in Europe.)
62. Years of analysis from the fields of urban economics and real estate provide sound explanations for the location of retailers in the aggregate. From the early foundations of Central Place Theory (described in more detail in Chapter 11) to more contemporary theories, there seems to be a mantra with four choruses. Retailers choose to:
	1. locate near pools of potential shoppers;
	2. locate within the range of wholesale distribution;
	3. locate on highly trafficked streets to ensure high visibility; and,
	4. locate in clusters of complementary stores to exploit network effects by maximizing attractiveness to customers.
63. Page 167
64. These key retail location decision criteria have been highlighted by others and can be explained by wanting to (a) take advantage of agglomeration economies and scale economies, (b) maximize visibility, access, and parking, and (c) minimize environmental impacts and complications within zoning and other resistance issues from the public.
65. The above factors lead to a tendency of stores wanting to cluster together, usually at locations of high regional and local access or visibility (e.g. major intersections or freeway ramps). They do so to achieve a market advantage. In addition, stores of all kinds try to take advantage of economies of scale. The location criteria combined with consumer characteristics have produced the pronounced retail structural trends seen in metro regions across the United States. These trends include:
	1. planned shopping centers dominating the retail market;
	2. smaller malls (still auto-reliant) clustering around major malls;
	3. a growing share of “Big Box” superstores in the retail market;
	4. dominant chains preferring stand-alone sites so as not to advantage competitors with spillover traffic;
	5. dining out continuing as a major factor in site design, as does;
	6. the convenience of services for driving to and through establishments.
66. Page 172
67. Measures of Effectiveness
68. Assuming the five criteria described in the Diamond of Evaluation cover the major goals of transport and land use planning prompts one to rescribe measures of effectiveness.
69. There is no single measure of effectiveness that adequately describes the transport or land use systems; likewise, there is no single measure that jointly describes efficiency, equity, experience, environment, or expediency. Planners are therefore forced to undertake the inconvenient but necessary task of employing several measures. Even so, some measures are more useful than others.
70. Although the list below is by no means definitive, it serves as a starting point for further discussion. MOEs should be:
	- Clear—align with user experience and be understood by those users;
	- Calculable—be measurable, from available (observable) data and be predictable, or able to be forecast;
	- Comparable—and useful in a regulatory or control context (so that the measure can be used as a basis for regulating new development in order to maintain standards, to rank projects so that better projects can be selected, or to help guide operational traffic engineering decisions).
	- Cumulative—scale or aggregate well (e.g. it should be possible to combine measures on separate links to obtain a measure for the entire trip); and
	- Comprehensive—be collectively complete—in a model sense—in that one could combine the MOEs to attain an overall measure.
71. It is also important to distinguish between the normative (what should be) and the positive (what is).
72. Page 194
73. The term design generally refers to notions of patterns, arrangements, or even blueprints; as mentioned in this chapter’s epigraph, Aristotle referred to it is as thinking made visible. Most people agree that design has a spatial or geographical component; it is commonly associated in transportation–land use contexts with the scale of buildings or the layout of roads. Limiting the meaning of the term to the smallest or most local attributes (i.e. the building), however, fails to recognize larger matters of how multiple buildings coalesce with streets in the design of cities.

76. Table 11.1 Layers of place, telecommunications, and plexus
77. Page 196
78. Layers of Plexus
79. The layers that define transport elements are specified, organized, operated, and financed separately. Each layer has rules of behavior, some of which are physical (either deterministic or probabilistic), and some of which are legal or customary rules that are occasionally violated.
80. Within the physical layer, there are elements that can be aggregated. In transportation, we model the world as if we have nodes or junctions, links, turns, paths, routes, and networks, as shown in Table 11.2. The node is the basic building block, and the other elements are collections of nodes. A node is just a point in space represented by coordinates.
81. A link is represented as two nodes, and may have associated with it specific attributes...
82. Page 197
83. .....(e.g. number of lanes, free-flow speed, permitted modes). A turn describes a movement at an intersection, which requires identifying the intersection (the at-node), as well as the start and end of the turn.
84. A path or route is just a sequence of nodes, and can be used to portray the route a bus may take, or a traveler may pursue from origin to destination. A network can be represented in a model as a table of nodes and links.
85. ... the street changes very little even when the streets are surrounded by suddenly empty lots.
86. Page 198
87. Morphology addresses the character or configuration of a community and its overall road network (e.g. the New Urbanist move ment suggests certain protocol for street patterns, building shapes and sizes, and patterns and composition of different types of land uses). Finally, architecture addresses the physical nature of any development and the networks connecting them (e.g. employing traffic calming on select streets).
88. Hierarchy of Place
89. Hierarchy is an intrinsic characteristic of any location.
90. The results are simple: there are fewer big places and more smaller ones, and big places have larger hinterlands than smaller ones.
91. Page 199
92. Central place theory, as it soon became known, suggested centralization is a natural principle of both hierarchy and order that human settlements follow. Furthermore, several rules governed what types of places sprung up and their character. Such “rules” suggested that: (a) the larger the size of cities, the fewer in number they will be, (b) the larger cities grow in size, the greater will be the distance between them, (c) the larger the size of a city, the greater the range and number of functions it will serve, and (d) the larger the city, the more higher-order services it will provide.
93. Page 202
94. Hierarchies of transport networks, on the other hand, are usually delineated in terms of capacity or speed. Capacity is defined as the number of vehicles or persons per hour that can move past a point. At the two extremes, there are freeways and local streets; in between are collectors, minor arterials, principal arterials, and regional or county high ways. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
95. The specific location of a facility, and its relationship with other links (both in terms of what traffic it carries, how much, and how fast) define its position within the hierarchy of roads.
96. Page 204
97. There are several rationales for network hierarchy, including:
	- aggregating traffic (economies of scale);
	- separating access and movement functions reduces conflict (makes both safer);
	- keeping residential neighborhoods quiet;
	- reducing redundancy in the transportation system;
	- excluding higher levels and separating layers (making financing by different agencies easier).

98. A consequence of a hierarchy of roads is that some links serve more local traffic and others serve more through traffic. A rational way to govern this kind of hierarchy is to assign roads to the most local unit of government from which a large share of traffic is coming or going.20
99. Page 205
100. Morphology
101. The term “morphology” is often employed by urban design or urban form professionals within the discipline of city planning to address the physical form of the city—focusing on, among other things, the street patterns, building shapes and sizes, and patterns and composition of different types of land uses. We employ it here to address the character or configuration of a community and its overall road network.
102. Page 207
103. The morphology of a city’s plexus (sometimes called topology) is important because the street network is nearly immutable once it is laid down. As development occurs, new networks are constructed (certainly this happens locally in any new suburban subdivision, where new roads fill the interstices within the existing coarser network that once served as farm-to-market roads).
104. The morphology and queuing properties of the plexus (its supply and demand) ultimately determine both the efficiency of the network in moving people and the efficiency of the land use. Radial (hub-and-spoke) networks allow easy access to the center but create inconvenient sharply angled parcels. In contrast, 90-degree grids maximize travel times (for anyone traveling in a diagonal direction) but create efficient parcels. A major issue with network topology is the interconnectedness of the network. Interconnected networks, be they grid or radial in nature, enable and even encourage through traffic, while a tree-like network discourages that problem. The topology of the network, grid, radial, organic (curvilinear) or otherwise, affects its performance.
105. Page 210
106. Recognizing that grid-based road networks might not lend themselves to locations that were not situated on flat, featureless plains, designers introduced several variations.
107. On a well-defined tree network, some children continue to go to school in their neighborhood, others are bused in from longer distances to compensate for declining enrollment. A flexible grid allows some children to go to school ten blocks away while others come from 20 blocks away. However, the neighborhoods in such a regime are more fluid in their ability to adapt over time and are less firmly defined by their structures. The identity of the neighborhood is lost to gain adaptability and identification with a larger whole. In more extreme cases—and in the spirit of form-based codes—the one-time school may even be converted to lofts in order to adapt to changing market conditions.
108. Page 214
109. Traffic calming is most often applied on residential streets that otherwise receive high levels of through traffic. But it may also be appropriate for shopping streets where a more pedestrian-oriented realm is desired, without completely excluding vehicles.
110. There are a variety of techniques for traffic calming36 as well as strategies for funding such improvements.37 The techniques include:
	- vertically altering the terrain via speed bumps, speed humps, speed tables, raised crossings, undulations, and variations in road texture or paving material;
	- horizontally altering the terrain via traffic circles and roundabouts, curb extensions (bulb-outs, neckdowns, chokers, chicanes/lateral shifts), median or pedestrian refuge islands, or the use of edgelines to narrow wide roadway and create bicycle lanes,parking lanes, or shoulders;
	- linearly altering the terrain via full closures or cul-de-sac conversion, half-closures (closing one direction), the installation of diverters (barriers at intersections to prohibit or require certain movements) or intersection realignment.
111. Page 217
112. In contrast to strategies for building and operating systems of place and plexus (which tend to be more science-oriented in their applications and are described in the following two chapters), the design of these systems weaves together art and science.
113. Design involves injecting a sense of art into the field of planning, and deciding what types of designs are superior to others. Rating forms of art, however, is difficult.
114. Page 234
115. Ideally, from a microeconomic perspective, networks are designed to maximize the (positive) difference between benefits and costs. This is often assessed on a project-by project basis using benefit–cost analysis. However, designing the combination of links that should be added is much more difficult. This is largely because of the combinatorics involved. There are many possible links; there are many more possible link combinations.
116. ....is, for practical purposes, impossible. There are a variety of algorithms that simplify the analysis,32 and don’t require testing every combination. In general, the network design problem takes a large part of the network as given, and considers which of a set of links, or expansions to existing links, to add to that network, subject to a budget constraint.
117. Page 235
118. Given a system-wide objective, add ing new links that compete with each other is unlikely to be a good strategy. Solutions to the network design problem (NDP) may determine not just which set of links to build, but the optimal order in which to build them.
119.  Instead, think of a network growth process occurring. Analysis of network growth is concerned with understanding the rules that describe what links and nodes in the network are added/deleted or expanded/contracted. These rules are not optimal in the sense of maximizing system efficiency, but have been judged by the jurisdictions that use them to be expedient, and perhaps to satisfy the need for a simple decision process. Rules such as expanding links when the traffic per lane exceeds some threshold are typical.33
120. Page 275
121. Predominant dogma in urban planning circles suggests that policy intervention is preferred because free markets bestow many problems. The planning profession, how ever, is increasingly realizing the error of its ways. Echoing Chapter 11, “we have met the enemy and (it) is us.”3 On a daily basis, several policies, considerably more mundane than urban renewal, interfere with the healthy functioning of networks and neighborhoods.
122. Many have equally detrimental effects. A number of problems are created by society itself, abetted by planners. These policies include, but are certainly not limited to:
	- land use regulations that reduce development densities and lead to more exclusive suburban communities than would otherwise arise;4
	- a zoning monoculture fostering sterile “garagescapes” in many suburban environments;5
	- minimum parking requirements designed to satisfy demand on one or two days a year, leaving acres of blacktop to absorb the sun and produce polluted runoff the rest of the year;6
	- transport standards mandating wide streets and a sweeping roadway geometry;7
	- transit systems that run nearly empty buses on suburban routes to ensure the political capital required to fund nearly full buses in the heart of the city (transit systems which are designed to serve not their customers, but rather potential customers).8
123. Page 276
124. A few core principles of evidence-based management include:
	- facing the hard facts, and building a culture in which people are encouraged to tell the truth, even if it is unpleasant;
	- committing to “fact based” decision-making—which means being committed to getting the best evidence and using it to guide actions;
	- treating your organization as an unfinished prototype; encourage experimentation and learning by doing;
	- looking for the risks and drawbacks in what people recommend; even the best medicine has side-effects;
	- avoid basing decisions on untested but strongly held beliefs, what you have done in the past, or on uncritical “benchmarking” of what winners do.
	- recognizing that some answers are unknown, but using the best models possible to make the best possible decision.
125. A counter argument to evidence-based planning is that evidence-based practices need to be balanced by the realization that some elements of transport and land use contexts are moving too quickly to furnish and fully rely on comprehensive evidence-based research.
126. A problem arises when policy experiments are, despite evidence to the contrary, declared successes and become institutionalized Comparative evaluation must be conducted. Continuation of failed experiments diverts resources from alternative uses. Every decision has an opportunity cost.
127. Page 277
128. transport professionals are at a disadvantage relative to other “cleaner” research available in fields such as medicine or business. Research involving transport and land use is riddled by a number of issues, including:
	- the relatively long lag times required for initiatives to take effect (some policies may take years to come to fruition);13
	- the difficulty of controlling for confounding effects that determine behavior (there are often many different reasons for individual decision-making);
	- the general impossibility of implementing rigorous experimental designs—under which a randomly selected control group would live and travel in controlled environs, and an experimental group might be exposed to various treatments—in free and democratic environments where people decide where to live and work;
	- the inability to monitor treatment and develop rigorously controlled studies (it is impossible to tell people where to live);
	- the marginal effect of many policies in a free society (there are larger economic forces influencing human behavior, such as the low costs of automobile travel); and
	- the lag time between gathering data and subsequent analysis (a matter that is undoubtedly improving but still an issue), and ultimately publication in a refereed journal.
	- Page 279
129. Accepting that urban areas are mature systems, one can deduce a central property of such systems: additional improvements to existing systems have marginal effects. Each additional network segment, for example, has a smaller effect in reducing travel time.
130. In mature transport–land use systems in metropolitan areas, incrementalist policies will have even more incremental effects. This is not to say that the benefits of incremental changes do not exceed their costs. It is just that incrementalism fails to solve the big urban transport problems previously described. It warrants understanding purported transport solutions in this context.
