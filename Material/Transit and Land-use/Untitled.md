Three types of data, modes of transport, the connections, & the places (starting from LU) 

1.  Access and Mobility Demand |Use research to better understand peopleâ€™s accessibility and mobility needs, preferences and abilities, and use social marketing strategies to develop better options that respond to these demand, and to encourage consumers to choose more efficient and equitable options.
2.  **Basic Access and Mobility (minimum threshold)** | Prioritize transportation improvements and activities to favor access to goods, services and activities considered most important to society.
3.  Mobility Improve traffic speed and capacity, such as improving and expanding roadways.
4.  **Transportation Options (Multimodal)** | Improve the convenience, comfort, safety, reliability, affordability and speed of transport options, including walking, cycling, automobile, rideshare, taxi, carshare and public transit.
5. User Information | Improve the quantity and quality of user information regarding travel and location options, including signs, maps, brochures, websites and telephone services. Special attention can be given to providing convenient information on alternative modes and efficient locations.
6. **Integration** | Improve connections between different modes and destinations, such as more ~~integrated information~~, fares, walkability, ~~baggage transfers~~, *automobile and bicycle parking*. 
7. **Affordability** | Improve the quantity and quality of affordable modes (walking, cycling, ridesharing, public transit, taxi and telework), and improve housing affordability in accessible locations.
8.  Mobility Substitutes | Improve the quantity and quality of telecommunications and delivery services that substitute for physical travel.
9.  **Land Use Factors** | Improve land use accessibility by increasing density and mix, in order to create activity centers and urban villages that contain the appropriate combination of housing, jobs and services within convenient walking and cycling distance.
10.  **Transport Network Connectivity** | Improve road and path connectivity to allow more direct travel between destinations, including special shortcuts for non-motorized travel where appropriate.
11.  **Roadway Design and Management** | Improve roadways to increase traffic flow (for example, by reducing the number of driveways), to favor higher occupant vehicles, and to improve walking and cycling conditions.
12.  **Prioritization** | Use mobility and parking management strategies to favor higher value trips and more resource-efficient vehicles, and to encourage more accessible land use development.
13.  *Improve Payment Systems* | Better road and parking pricing methods reduce transaction costs and increase the feasibility of implementing pricing reforms to increase overall transportation system efficiency.
14.  ~~Inaccessibility | Where appropriate, limit mobility and accessibility.
