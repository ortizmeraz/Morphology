Making existing cities and new urban development more ecologically based and liveable is an urgent priority in the global push for sustainability. This paper discusses ten critical responses to this issue and summarizes them in a simple conceptual model that places the nexus between transport and urban form at the heart of developing an eco-city. This involves compact, mixed-use urban form, well-defined higher-density, human-oriented centres, priority to the development of superior public transport systems and conditions for non-motorized modes, with minimal road capacity increases, and protection of the city’s natural areas and food-producing capacity. These factors form the framework in which everything else is embedded and must operate, and if they are not addressed only marginal changes in urban sustainability can be made. Within this framework, environmental technologies need to be extensively applied. Economic growth needs to emphasize creativity and innovation and to strengthen the environmental, social and cultural amenities of the city. The public realm throughout the city needs to be of a high quality, and sustainable urban design principles need to be applied in all urban development. All these dimensions need to operate within two key processes involving vision-oriented and reformist thinking and a strong, community-oriented, democratic sustainability framework for decision-making.

## Bullet points
           

- This paper sets out ten critical responses to the challenge of changing the nature of urban development to a more ecological, sustainable model. These dimensions have at their core the issue of urban transport systems and their relationship to urban form, and therefore focus primarily on the problems of reducing automobile dependence in cities, building more sustainable urban form and creating more liveable places.

- The ten critical eco-city dimensions discussed here are the following:

1. **The city has a compact, mixed-use urban form that uses land efficiently and protects the natural environment, biodiversity and food-producing areas**.

	- How much land a city requires to house its people and accommodate its economic activities is critical in determining its sustainability, especially its transport patterns and impacts. The shape and form of a city sets the basic framework within which everything else about the city has to operate.

	- Urban form, as measured by urban density and the centralization of jobs, is found to have a very strong relationship with transport patterns, especially the level of car dependence and the effectiveness of public transport.(4)

	- The strong relationship revealed by many studies between more compact, mixed-use urban form and reduced car use is reflected in efforts around the world to reduce urban sprawl and create more transit-oriented communities.(7)

	- Overall, the positive effects on urban transport patterns of higher density and more centralized land use are clear, and are further elaborated in subsequent sections. Higher densities can bring greater protection of the natural environment and food-growing areas in and around cities.

2. **The natural environment permeates the city’s spaces and embraces the city, while the city and its hinterland provide a major proportion of its food needs**.

	- A city that is striving to be more ecologically sound will inevitably be concerned about access to green space and food security.

	- The potential for “green living” in the city depends significantly on different views about the merits of low- versus high-density living and the best way of “restoring the commons”.

	- The first view suggests that growing one’s own food, practicing permaculture, recycling liquid and solid wastes, using decentralized energy and water supplies, and generally “living green” is only possible in a low-density rural or semi-rural context. The city is seen as needing to be broken down into smaller settlements that will bring rural qualities and values back to the city.

	- The second view is less concerned with self-sufficiency than with the integrity of the urban system. It suggests that creating higher-density development will mean less land devoted to sprawl and more land for open space, gardens, urban agriculture, forestry and horticulture. Greater emphasis on community spaces should also mean more opportunity for locally managed systems for waste, energy and water. The “urban commons” approach promotes a city that is “greener” in its overall functioning through more use of green transport modes, traffic calming to promote greener, safer streets, less energy use and less environmental impact.

3. **Freeway and road infrastructure are de-emphasized in favour of transit, walking and cycling infrastructure, with a special emphasis on rail. Car and motorcycle use are minimized.**

	- There is some evidence that motorcycles have flourished in high-density, congested urban areas where segregated public transport systems are weak or absent

	- Overall modal split patterns. Walking and cycling are the most sustainable modes of transport,…

	- Importance of rail and comparative modal speeds. The data highlight the integral role of urban rail systems in achieving high public transport ridership.

-	Without a commitment to better quality public transport systems, especially rail, and better conditions for pedestrians and cyclists, it is difficult for any city to become more sustainable.

4. **There is extensive use of environmental technologies for water, energy and waste management – the city’s life support systems become closed loop systems.**

	- Cities are consumers of natural capital such as water, energy and other resources, and producers of large quantities of wastes, which must be absorbed by the natural systems upon which cities depend. There is now a well-documented view that cities are “parasitic organisms”. It has been shown that the ecological footprint of prosperous cities already extends many times beyond the areas of land that they actually occupy, while innumerable other less resource-consuming, though fast-growing, cities in lower-income nations are increasing their impacts at an alarming rate.(23)

	- If cities are to become sustainable, they must reduce their use of all resources and decrease their waste outputs. At the same time, they must increase their liveability in terms of health, employment, income, education, housing, leisure activities, accessibility, urban design quality and sense of community and neighbourhood. This argument has been systematized in terms of an “extended metabolism” model of human settlements.(27)

5. **The central city and sub-centres within the city are human centres that emphasize access and circulation by modes of transport other than the automobile, and absorb a high proportion of employment and residential growth.**

	- Among the most important parts of any city are its central business district and sub-centres. The greatest concentration of jobs in most cities remains in the central city, despite the suburbanization of work and the falling percentage of people employed in city centres.(32) The high and generally increasing number of jobs and amount of floor space mean that the central city still significantly shapes transport patterns. Public transport systems, especially rail, are focused on central cities, and congestion on radial routes is widespread.

	- The high profile status of the central city and intense traffic pressure mean that this area is almost always the focal point for new rail systems, and is the first to adopt such sustainable transport and planning policies as pedestrianization, urban design and streetscape improvements, trafficcalming schemes, control over parking provision, road-pricing schemes to reduce traffic, and residential revitalization.

6. **The city has a high-quality public realm throughout that expresses a public culture, community, and equity and good governance. The public realm includes the entire transit system and all the environments associated with it.**

	- Discussions on eco-cities too easily focus on physical and biological systems, forgetting that cities have been created to enrich humankind and enable its progress.(45) If we forget this, we lose sight of the qualities needed to make great cities. In a wide-ranging article, Barber discusses the problems and possibilities confronting Canadian cities:(46)

7. **The physical structure and urban design of the city, especially its public environments, are highly legible, permeable, robust, varied, rich, visually appropriate and personalized for human needs.**

	- Others have developed a host of measurable design qualities that need to be incorporated into urban development, as follows:(51)

		- *Permeability* – places that are permeable provide access and a number of alternative routes through an area, a choice of how to get to places and have a clear definition between public and private places.

		- *Variety* – variety is concerned with the range of uses available to people. Places that have variety offer experiential choice, but only if they can be accessed, and they attract a variety of people at various times for varied reasons.

		- *Legibility* – legibility is about how easily people can understand a place, and how quickly they can interpret what goes on there. Legible places enable an understanding of how to negotiate an area. Legibility can be achieved through street function, landmarks and different land uses.

		- *Robustness* – robustness is the flexibility to use a place for a variety of purposes, especially over a long period of time. Robustness is the means by which cities survive and are “recycled” according to the needs of each era.

		- *Visual appropriateness*, richness and personalization – these qualities are about the appearance and enjoyment of places. Places that display visual appropriateness and richness contain buildings that seem to “fit” with the streetscape. They can be interpreted easily by many people and create satisfying sensory experiences. Visually appropriate places have uses that match their physical appearance. Personalization is concerned with how comfortable and familiar a place is and how well it engenders a sense of belonging.

8. **The economic performance of the city and employment creation are maximized through innovation, creativity and the uniqueness of the local environment, culture and history, as well as the high environmental and social quality of the city’s public environments.**
	- Any city aspiring to sustainability cannot ignore its economic  dimension.	
	- This world city network has heightened the competition between urban regions for global capital and jobs. Rather than employees going to where companies are locating, the new “creative class” of employees dictate, to some extent, where companies locate, according to the quality of life being offered by the city, and demand that cities be vibrant, liveable and indeed walkable places, offering a wide range of attractions.
	- Charles Landry describes how cities have to become creative to  develop economic activities that help them compete for economic  success, while at the same time respecting their local environments, skills and traditions.(57)
	- Despite some disagreement, there is little argument that part of the  struggle today to develop a better urban economy is to create places that are environmentally and socially attractive, whereas it can be argued that cities that do not have the automobile under control run their environments down
9. **Planning for the future of the city is a visionary “debate and decide” process, not a “predict and provide”, computer-driven process**.
	- **“Predict and provide”** planning. For any city aspiring to greater sustainability, the way it envisions its future and, in particular, the way it plans its future transport systems in relation to land use, will be critical.
	- A new “scientific” and professional endeavour was born through the transport planning and traffic engineering disciplines. The basic philosophy of the UTP process was to plan for infrastructure supply to meet projected traffic growth – a “predict and provide” approach. This approach became characterized by self-fulfilling prophecies of spiralling traffic growth, congestion and road building.(62)
	- **“Debate and decide”** planning. Congestion relief and everexpanding mobility, rather than accessibility, have been pillars of the UTP process for many years. There is now, however, an awareness that the road-building treadmill created by over-reliance on computer model predictions of traffic growth needs to change. --
	- This awareness has manifested itself in some basic questions being asked in cities, in particular about the goals and modus operandi of transport planning.  
		- What kind of city do we want in the future?  
		- Can our urban environment sustain the predicted levels of future traffic?  
		- Would we not benefit more from actually reducing traffic?  
		- Are there other options, and how do we break out of trend-based planning?  
		- What are the land use options for the city that will curb automobile travel?  
		- Can we manage demand for private transport and optimize use of  the existing road network by making strategic investments in public transport, walking and cycling?  
		- Can the process of the last 50 years be reversed by reducing, not  expanding, road space?

10. **All decision-making is sustainability-based, integrating social, economic, environmental and cultural considerations as well as compact, transit-oriented urban form principles. Such decisionmaking processes are democratic, inclusive, empowering and engendering of hope**.
	- It is not surprising then that for sustainable development to be implemented, quite radical departures from normal planning and decisionmaking processes in cities will be required. This is why there are many activities in cities around the world that are establishing visions of sustainable development and how these can be realized. The key defining characteristics of these efforts are their engagement with diverse “communities” or “stakeholders” that constitute any city today, and their capacity to infuse a new sense of hope about urban futures. A handful of the better examples are summarized here. Newman and Jennings provide a detailed overview.(69)
