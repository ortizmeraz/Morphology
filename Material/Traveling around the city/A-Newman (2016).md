```ad-abstract
The theory of urban fabrics is outlined showing how different types of cities are combinations of walking, transit and automobile fabrics based on their transport systems and universal travel time budget. The distances/transport speeds that generate these urban fabrics and their associated elements, functions, and qualities are outlined emphasizing for the first time how tasks of statutory planning and transport planning are different in the three urban fabrics. The theory is demonstrated in the Finnish city of Kuopio and with data from the authors’ Global Cities Database concluding with three different statutory and strategic planning approaches.

## Bullet points
1. This paper will show how the three urban fabrics of walking city, transit city and automobile city have formed and now in combination have an on-going life of their own with distinct and important differences in their fabric elements, qualities, lifestyles and economies. Most of all it will show how strategic and statutory planning needs to do more than land use and transport integration, but they need to have different approaches in each of the three urban fabrics. P2
2. The [[theory of urban fabrics]] suggests that **all cities can be described by a combination of these three urban fabrics.** This paper will provide a semi-quantitative basis for showing how these urban fabrics combine in different types of cities and how these cities and their fabrics can be understood in terms of their spatial dimensions through several case studies. The theory and its associated framework is explanatory and predictive, but it also will always depend on the peculiarities of geography, history, culture and politics to fully explain or predict the combinations of the three fabrics, but that is normal in town planning. P10
3. **Walking cities have existed for the majority of settlement history since walking** was the only form of transport available to enable people to get across their cities at walking speeds of around 3-4 km/h. **Thus walking cities were dense (usually over 100 people per ha), mixed-use areas with narrow streets, and were no more than 3 to 4 kilometres across, or roughly 2km in radius. The most intensive part was generally within 1 km radius.** P5 
4. The transit urban fabric since 1850 was based first on trains and then trams. The steam train began to link cities from the 1820’s and then began to be the basis of train-based suburbs from the 1850’s. This led to early transit cities, which were followed by the later transit cities of trams (from the 1890’s) that extended the urban fabric of the old walking cities (Hall, 1992). Both trams and trains could travel faster than walking – trams with average speeds of around 10-20 km/h and trains at around 20 – 40 km/h. This meant cities could now spread out in two ways with trams forming the urban fabric of the inner transit city 10-20 kms across, based very often on a regular grid street structure with trams operating on many of those streets (5-10 km radius with an average around 8 kms) and with trains forming areas of the outer transit urban fabric 20 – 40 kilometers across (10-20 kms radius). P5 
5. As urban development was no longer anchored to fixed-track systems, it could be extended to wherever roads could be built. Hence the opportunity to continue creating transit city corridors was replaced by large continuous suburbs first in cities of the USA, Australia and Canada and later in many kinds of cities around the world. Buses became merely supplementary to cars in the new automobile-based urban fabric. Cities which became automobile cities thus provided limited public transit to support their sprawling suburbs, mostly through infrequent and slow regular bus services without bus lanes, Within a generation such areas became the basis of automobile dependence (Newman and Kenworthy, 1989) and automobility (Urry, 2004). P7
6. The automobile urban fabric, which overlaps and covers all the walking urban fabric and all the transit urban fabric, in many cases can obliterate them (e.g. in US cities such as Detroit). In numerous cases it has been so dominating it has destroyed the underlying transit and walking urban fabrics. It can, however, also work in symbiosis with the transit and walking urban fabrics, e.g. visitors from the automobile urban fabric often come by car to these other fabrics and if parking and other automobile city elements are not unduly disturbing the transit and walking qualities of these areas, then the extra people add to the value of the walking or transit urban fabric and functions. P9
7. City size generally indicates the age of the city and the potential for a longer period of growth in the walking city and transit city eras. It also means that this fabric can be built upon to create extensions of the walking city and transit urban fabrics. P10
8. Findings by fabrics can easily be combined to achieve comprehensive conclusions concerning the city as a whole or left for each fabric in a local area. This is a good basis to handle and supervise the dynamic and dialectic processes of the city and its planning through strategic and statutory planning. P16
9. The main source of observations has been the daily practical experience of the City of Kuopio over the past 20 years as it applied the theory in its planning needs and has been added to through the global experiences of the other authors. The tables show:
	- Fabric areas (spatial dimensions, areas, sub-areas and overlaps for each urban fabric);
	- Fabric elements (physical components which are the working buildings and infrastructure that enable each urban fabric to function in its own way);
	- Fabric functions (the habits, ways of life and business functions of the users and providers in each fabric);
	- Fabric qualities (the measurable outcomes in terms of urban form, transport, economic, social and environmental qualities in each urban fabric). P16-17

Tables 2 to 5 show a significant and important set of differences between these three kinds of transport-related urban fabrics. Table 5, showing the variety of different qualities characteristic of the three urban fabrics, indicates why planning is increasingly aiming to rebuild more walking and transit fabric and minimise the extension of automobile urban fabric (Sassen, 1994; Newman, 1995; Dodson and Sipe, 2008; Newman et al, 2009). This theory of three urban fabrics is at odds with the modernist based theories and concepts of cities that have been almost universally applied in urban development for most of the latter half of the 20th century (see Newman, 2015). 17-21 (Newman et al., 2016)

Table 6. Statutory Guidelines to Reduce Automobile Dependence in Three Urban Fabrics

           
10. The greater value of walking and transit urban fabric is now appearing as the phenomenon of peak car use suggests that the age of automobile dependent urban planning dominance is over and the need to extend this into car-based suburbs has become a high priority in town planning. Rejuvenating old and building new, attractive walking and transit urban fabric across the city will require creativity by town planners and transport planners who will need different strategic and statutory manuals for built form typologies that fit the different urban fabrics. Without this the dominant automobile city framework will still be used despite the economic, environmental and social demand for more walking and transit fabric. P23
