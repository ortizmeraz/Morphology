2. The challenge is to improve the quality of life in urban communities, maintaining economic viability while promoting sustainable development. This involves developing competitive cities that benefit from the economic advantages brought about by globalisation, increasing GDP and higher levels of personal income.
3. Land use and transport issues intersect with these challenges – whether as part of the problem or as part of the solution. Central here is the fundamental question of how to improve land use and urban planning and to strengthen the links with sustainable urban transport. The principle barriers are institutional, legislative, financial, social and cultural (Banister and Marshall, 2000; ECMT, 2002).
4. Since that time, urban planning has continuously struggled for its own identity as it has interfaces with so many aspects of society.
5. The nature of planning is also different to many other disciplines as the methods and processes are eclectic, often being borrowed from other disciplines. Similarly, there is a strong desire for action, not just knowledge.
6. More recently, the environment has become a new focus for land use and urban planning.
7. People and business are now leaving the city as the perceived quality of life has deteriorated, and as modern lifestyles and activities no longer require such close proximity of homes, workplaces and other activities. Transport, particularly suburban rail and above all the car, has had an instrumental role in this decentralisation process.
8. This debate has been most active with respect to the crucial role that transport has in achieving sustainable development. The catalyst for the debate was the study of 32 major world cities (Newman and  Kenworthy, 1991) which claimed to demonstrate clearlinks between transport and urban form, at least at the city level.
9. The basic disagreement is whether the promotion of compact cities is an appropriate planning goal (Ewing, 1997; Gordon and Richardson, 1997). On the one hand, there are those (principally Gordon and Richardson) who are strongly in favour of market forces for the allocation of land for development, for the decisions on residential densities, for the achievement of energy resource savings, for the promotion of city centre development, for the maintenance of competition between cities, for the examination of the equity implications of compactness and for the balancing of the impacts of suburbanisation.
10. The empirical evidence is complex and causality is difficult to demonstrate. There does seem to be some limited impact on land markets from joint developments at rail transit stations (Cervero, 1994), mainly in the form of slightly higher rents and lower vacancy rates. But in the most comprehensive study over 20 years of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) in San Francisco, Cervero and Landis (1997) have not found compact, orderly growth with a multi-centred settlement pattern.
11. Yet even here data limitations make comparison difficult, and this is further complicated by the social and economic structures of cities which are so different.
12. The sustainable city needs to be examined within its region, to encompass its labour market area and its wider sphere of influence.
13. Table 2.1 identifies a set of seven perspectives on land use and transport. These perspectives cut across and interlink with each other, and they should not be looked at in isolation.
14. Shopping, for example, may be to some extent a means to an end (to access products) but may also be an attractive pastime in its own right. Similarly, work may also be seen as a means to an end (labour in return for wages) but also as an activity that directly contributes to an individual’s self-fulfilment.
15. And although travel is conventionally regarded as a derived demand – a non-productive activity essentially undertaken for the sake of reaching a destination – travel may be undertaken for its own sake.
16. Costs and Benefits
17. Land uses are associated with productive or attractive activities that may be associated with benefits, which give rise to the desire or demand for travel. Travel itself is conventionally associated with cost, namely the cost necessary to make a trip to access the benefit at the destination.
18. The Network Model
19. In conventional transport analysis and modelling, the transport system is considered as a network comprising a series of nodes and links to which are connected zones representing trip origins and destinations.
20. From this perspective, the land use and transport components are quite distinct, although parts of the same ‘model’.
21. This ‘network model’ perspective of land use and transport is integrated in the sense that both land use and transport components are represented, and may be used successfully to predict travel movements on the network, given certain land uses LU→T.
22. Infrastructure and Land Area
23. From another perspective, transport is a land use itself. The transport land use comprises (at least) roads, streets, paths, car parks, highways, petrol stations, railways, stations, railway yards and airports.
24. Although the ultimate objectives and societal values may be shared between the professions, their working methods, conceptual paradigms and institutional practices are often quite distinct and sometimes in conflict.
25. The Policy Dimension
26. The purpose of land use and transport policy-making is to intervene in the land development and transport systems for the public good.
27. It is true that conflicts may arise where there is competition for use of scarce urban land, for municipal resources, or conflict between incompatible activities – but these conflicts can occur within either the transport or land use policy sphere (e.g. noise or pollution concern impacting from one land use to another, or from one transport mode to another) and are not intrinsically a function of transport versus land use policy.
28. CITIES AND LAND USE – TRANSPORT RESEARCH
29. ‘City of Tomorrow and Cultural Heritage’ was the title of a key action of the European Commission’s Fifth Research Framework Programme, ... Four interrelated themes were covered by this programme including
- Urban governance and sustainable resource management
- Cultural heritage
- Sustainable built environment
- Sustainable transport.
