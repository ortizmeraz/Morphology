```ad-conclussion
The papers in this VSI were presented during four paper sessions at by the 2018 annual meeting of the American Association of Geographers in New Orleans, which sought to expand the debate on justice in the context of transport and mobility. The papers provide further insight of the complex and situated nature of the debate around transport and mobility justice through the diversity of theoretical insights and case studies they discuss. While not necessarily questioning the nature of mobility and sometimes maintaining a distributive outlook, the contributions build on the third strand of theoretical diversification we highlighted and show concrete examples of how mobility justice can be understood and researched. Taking heed of Sheller's proposal, they also illustrate how the directions proposed by Davidson and Karlsson become a necessary move for mobility studies.

2. questions of transport or mobility justice.
3. Early examples include the use of physical accessibility as a social indicator of the ease with which different social groups can reach destinations and services for the evaluation of government policies (Wachs and Kumagai, 1973) and the work on the spatial mismatch hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, housing market discrimination and limited access to private vehicles hampered the opportunities of African-Americans and thirdly, the recent publication of Mimi Sheller's (2018b)Mobility Justice: The Politics of Movement in an Age of Extremes has integrated work on transport and mobility justice by proposing that issues of transport at the spatial scales of individuals and urban areas.
4. The integration works out in the temporal domain as well: she places the daily movements of people and decadal rhythms of changes in transport infrastructure and urban structure within the longue durée of changes in capitalism, colonialism, and extractivism.
5. scholarship on spatial containment and entrapment of women of different racial/ethnic backgrounds (Hanson and Pratt, 1995; Preston and McLafferty, 2016); studies of the uneven distribution of the benefits and costs of transport subsidies, policies and infrastructure development (Hodge, 1988; Hay, 1993; Murray and Davis, 2001; Foth et al., 2013; Pereira et al., 2019); and work on how transport disadvantage and social exclusion interact with each other (Lucas, 2012; Lucas et al., 2016).
6. importantly, a host of societal developments have thrown questions of transport and mobility justice into sharp relief. These developments include the historically unparalleled impetus to build ‘fast’ transport systems – elevated highways, flyovers, bus rapid transit, and so forth –
7. The developments also relate to the uneven consequences of austerity urbanism (Peck, 2012) on everyday mobilities and sociotechnical innovations in transport.
8. developed a series of concepts to aid understanding of uneven mobilities, such as ‘motility’, or the capacity to become mobile (Kaufmann, 2002), and analysed the multiple ways in which discourses legitimise and normalise uneven mobilities (Sheller, 2018a).
9. over the last decade transport, from cycling to aviation, has become a quintessential site of contestation and the political due to of the broader conversations that, certainly in the discipline of Geography, have occurred between ‘transport’ and ‘mobilities’ (Shaw and Hesse, 2010;Cidell and Prytherch, 2015; Kwan and Schwanen, 2016).
10. à la Mouffe (2005) – the domain of antagonism where “questions always involve decisions which require us to make a choice between conflicting alternatives” (page 10).
11. A second reason is that researchers in different fields and communities have been drawing on the same conceptual resources in attempts to examine

13. Automobility is increasingly the stuff of culture wars: Should this sociotechnical system be curbed and actively broken down because of detrimental effects on the environment, public health, and social equity?
14. Zooming out from the surge of interest in questions of transport and mobility justice, we can identify at least four tendencies and impulses in recent and current research on transport and mobility justice:
	1. Theoretical development and diversification;
	2. Enhancing the recognition of the needs, experiences, and understandings of everyday mobility;
	3. Expanding the understanding of the causes of injustice in transport and mobilities; and
	4. Development of new and different methodologies and methods for understanding and addressing in/justice in transport and mobilities.
	5. The boundary between state- and society-centric research is fluid and work on either side is proliferating. It nonetheless appears that the growth in interest among both transport geographers and mobilities scholars is particularly stark in society-centric research.

	7. Enright's conception of transit justice edges towards Sheller's (2018a, 2018b) multi-scalar concept of mobility justice introduced earlier. Both direct attention towards the ways in which power and inequality shape people's movements, motility and immobility, as well as the attempts of states and other actors to govern and control mobility
	8. One strand of work has been influenced heavily by work in feminist theory, in particular by Young (1990) and Fraser (1996). In its simplest form, this means a broadening out in focus from distribution to also consider (Karner et al., 2020; Schwanen, 2020):
	9. This reflects the grounding of Sheller's conceptualisation in a mobile ontology with three key attributes. She holds, firstly, that spatial and temporal scales are entangled, and secondly that movements, meanings, and values coevolve with each other and in close connection with difference, subject formation, and embodiment.
	- Procedure: the nature of decision-making and governance, including the level of participation, inclusiveness, and influence participants can wield.
	- Recognition: acknowledgment of and respect for the rights, needs, values, understandings, and customs of groups involved in, or affected by, decision making and governance.
10. She finally proposes that transport, environmental, and climate justice are inevitably entwined and co-constituted.
11. Drawing in particular on feminist and black feminist thought (e.g. Grosz, 2017; Ferreira da Silva, 2017), Davidson proposes to move further away from questions about distribution through two moves. The first of these is to understand mobility as a material-semiotic process of energetic transformation through death and/or the foregoing of forms of life: the movement of humans hinges on metabolisms, either of those humans themselves when they eat or drink organic matter in some form to move themselves through their physical environments,
12. The second move is to understand justice in terms of an immanent ethics that is not premised on universal, abstract and externally specified rules but on a collective and impersonal ethos – a set of self-imposed limits and emergent and likely place-specific ways of living that “define a purpose, values, targets for change, and potential techniques for change”
13. By recognising and examining particular mobility needs, experiences, values and practices, the papers show how transport and mobility (in)justice emerge from the everyday practices of various urban actors.
