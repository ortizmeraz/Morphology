```ad-abstract
Purpose – This paper aims to investigate the possibility that the typology of a service as well as the operationalization of the service measurement scale may determine the nature of the service quality (SQ) construct and its relationship with those of customer satisfaction (SAT) and behavioral intentions (BI).

Design/methodology/approach – The study utilized the service classification scheme developed by Schmenner and concentrated on the mass service category as an example to illustrate the concept with data from retail banking.

Findings – Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that “Responsiveness,” “Tangibility,” “Reliability,” “Knowledge,” and “Accessibility” dimensions contribute significantly to service quality. It was further observed that SAT fully mediates the impact of SQ on BI.

Research limitations/implications – A notable limitation is that the present study focuses only on mass service and uses only one industry (retail banking) to illustrate the findings. Future research should examine other service categories.

Practical implications – Service managers in the mass service category are recommended to devise operations and marketing strategies that focus on the SQ dimensions which can enhance customer satisfaction and, in turn, foster positive behavioral intentions.

Originality/value – This study presents a methodology for developing an operationizable service quality construct. It demonstrates that SQ, SAT and BI and their interrelationships may be typology-specific. Thus, two or more industries may exhibit similar relationship characteristics with regard to these constructs, if they belong to the same service category. This knowledge can lead to inter-industry benchmarking of best practices that can lead to better customer satisfaction and behavioral intentions.

2. Over the past 40 years, several authors have attempted to develop coherent classification schemes for services. The intent of such schemes is to bring parsimony and order allowing for a better understanding of the characteristics that differentiate services and the organizations that provide them.

4. research in the service discipline has grown tremendously in the past decade.
	1. service quality (SQ)
	2. behavioral intentions (BI)
	3. customer satisfaction (SAT)
5. In Schmenner’s (1986, 2004) classification work, the typology to which a company belongs is used to provide some explanations for productivity performance. In this paper, we investigate the possibility that the typology of a service as well as the operationalization (or otherwise) of the service measurement scale may determine the SQ construct and its relationships to the SAT and BI constructs.
6. In his earlier work, Schmenner (1986) divided the landscape of services into four quadrants framed by labor intensity on the y-axis and customer contact/customization on the x-axis. Labor intensity is defined as the ratio of labor cost incurred to the value of the plant and equipment. Thus, a high labor-intensive service business involves relatively little plant and equipment cost, but a considerable labor time. On the other hand, the customer contact/customization axis consists of a joint measure of customer contact (the degree to which customer interacts with the service process) and customization (the degree to which the service is customized for the customer).

8. Degree of variation in the customization and interaction replaces customization axis; and relative throughput time (a measure of productivity) replaces labor intensity axis.
9. For detailed justification of this issue, the reader is referred to Schmenner (2004). In any case, this system classified services into four quadrants: (1) Service factory – low relative throughput time, low degree of variation (e.g. airlines, express service trucking, hotels, resorts and recreation). (2) Service shop – low relative throughput time and high degree of variation (e.g. hospitals, traditional restaurants (excluding fast food), auto and other repair services). (3) Mass service – high relative throughput time and low degree of variation (e.g. retail banking, schools, wholesaling, and traditional long-distance ground trucking). (4) Professional service – high relative throughput time and high degree of variation (e.g. law firms, accounting firms, medical clinics).
10. Schmenner (1986) classified the retail banking industry as a mass service. Mass service industries have a low degree of variation in customer interaction/ customization.
11. Schmenner (1986) also suggested that in a mass service, constant attention is needed in the employee hiring and training process to ensure that “wastes” in the service delivery process do not slow down the throughput time.

13. Context specificity of the SQ constructs
14. In the present paper, we propose that the context specificity is not necessarily the industry, but rather it is the typology of service. Several concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that the typology of service (context specificity) may explain some discrepancies in the results of past research regarding the nature and dimensions of the SQ construct.
15. First, would the dimensions of the performance-only construct (SERVPERF) replicate the SERVQUAL’s five dimensions? Second, which dimensions of SQ will be dominant in each service context (e.g. in mass service), given that the measurement items have been operationalized (Lapierre, 1996)?
16. classification scheme suggest and predict the dimensions that will likely be dominant in the mass service context are:
17. “Tangibility” (includes the physical facilities, equipment, and appearance of personnel).
18. “Responsiveness” (the willingness or readiness of employees or professionals to provide service targeted to customers’ specific needs).
19. “Knowledge” (the knowledge and competence of service providers, possession of necessary skills, etc.).
20. “Accessibility” (the service provider’s ability – through its location, operating hours, employees and operational systems – to design and deliver the service capable of adjusting to the demands and wishes of customers in a flexible way).
21. “Reliability” (the degree to which customers can rely on the service provider to keep promises and perform with the best interests of the customers).

23. Discussion and managerial implications
24. We set out to investigate the possibility that the typology of a service as well as the operationalization (or otherwise) of the service measurement scale may determine the SQ construct and its relationships to the SAT and BI constructs.
25. In other words, two or more industries may exhibit similar relationship characteristics with regards to these constructs if they belong to the same typology and the construct items are operationalized.

27. Service typology and the SQ construct
28. Since different service typologies may emphasize different dimensions of SQ, it is important to know the typology in order to prepare properly the service employees to serve the customers better. As Lapierre (1996) put it, searching for a universal conceptualization of SQ may prove futile. As such, we employed a performance only approach (Cronin and Taylor, 1992) to develop an instrument (by means of the WTA process) suitable for service firms in the “mass service” category Using the retail banking industry as an illustrative example for a mass service, six SQ dimensions were captured in the present study.
29. The “Recovery” dimension was found to play little or no role in the customers’ minds as they assess SQ in this mass service setting (retail banking).

31. ... in the “Responsiveness” dimension (e.g. RES 2: the employees adapt banking services to our needs; RES 3: our requests are handled promptly) and/or the “Reliability” dimension, and thus yield an indistinct outcome.
32. One advantage of the second-order model proposed in the present study is that it provides an opportunity for service providers to analyze customers’ perceptions of SQ at a higher level of abstraction. On the one hand, the second-order model yields direct, actionable information at the attribute level (i.e. individual indicators in each of the first-order factors) for service managers. On the other hand, it allows service mangers to assess the contribution of a theoretically important component of the latent construct and their relationship with other related construct (e.g., satisfaction)

34. Finally, further empirical research needs to investigate the effect of service typology on the nature of the SQ construct and its relationship with SAT and BI in the settings of service shop, service factory and professional service.
