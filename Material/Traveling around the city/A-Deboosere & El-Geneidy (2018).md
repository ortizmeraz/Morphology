Accessibility, or the ease of reaching destinations, is increasingly being used and examined in both literature and practice. The most common accessibility metric, the cumulative opportunity measure, is often computed as the number of jobs that can be reached within a certain time frame. Aggregating all jobs, however, often inflates the opportunities that can be reached by socially vulnerable residents, which could feed into and/or generate inadequate policy decisions. This study therefore develops the measure of accessibility to  low-income jobs for vulnerable residents by public transport, specifically taking into account realized travel times by these vulnerable individuals. This fine-grained measure, computed across 11 major Canadian cities, is a modified place-based accessibility metric that incorporates facets of person-based metrics, allowing planners and policy makers to propose more targeted interventions to improve the quality of life of their cities' most vulnerable populations. The study further allows for direct comparisons between the impacts of variation in accessibility levels between different regions to help create best practices in land use and transport planning.

3. Transport and land use planning are inextricably linked.
4. Accessibility, or the ease of reaching destinations, is now increasingly being used to operationalize integrated land use and transport planning and to act as a performance indicator for these concepts

6. Starting with Hansen (1959) (and somewhat later Wickstrom (1971), Ingram (1971) and Dalvi and Martin (1976), among others), a growing body of literature has been continuously refining the concept of accessibility (El-Geneidy and Levinson, 2006; El-Geneidy et al., 2016;
7. Geurs and van Wee, 2004; Levinson, 1998, 2014; van Wee and Geurs, 2011). By far the most widely used metric for accessibility is the number of jobs an individual can reach within a set time limit (known as a cumulative opportunity measure) (Boisjoly and El-Geneidy, 2017b).
8. Contemporary research, however, relies on accessibility to jobs metrics that lack the ability to accurately discern between distinct populations; all jobs are usually counted as being accessible for everyone, as long as they can be reached.

10. Literature review
11. Accessibility, or the ease of reaching destinations, is a comprehensive metric measuring the interaction between land use and transportation (El-Geneidy and Levinson, 2006; Handy and Niemeier, 1997).
12. Accessibility is generally understood to comprise four main components: land use, transportation, time, and the individual (Geurs and van Wee, 2004).
13. Place-based accessibility metrics measure accessibility at a certain point in space, and usually only incorporate land use and transport factors due to data limitations.
14. Person-based metrics, on the other hand, founded in space-time geography, focus on the individual, and thus also incorporate e.g. time budgets and socio-economic in formation (Geurs and van Wee, 2004).
15. Cumulative opportunity measures of accessibility count how many destinations can be reached from a certain point in space within a certain time threshold using a certain mode, strategies (Morris et al., 1979).
16. A third set of commonly used measures are the utility based accessibility metrics, which assign each destination with a specific utility and calculate the logsum of all destinations within a potential choice set (Handy and Niemeier, 1997).
17. As several studies have found that the cumulative opportunities measure of accessibility is highly correlated to the gravity-based measure, and because the cumulative metric is the easiest to communicate to decision makers (El Geneidy and Levinson, 2006), the cumulative measure has been adopted in recent studies comparing accessibility across cities (Owen et al., 2016).
18. Páez et al. (2010) developed an accessibility measure that compromises between detailed person-based metrics and generalizable place-based measures, which “gives much needed flexibility to in vestigate accessibility trends specific to a population segment and a location in space” (see also (Páez et al., 2013)).
19. Accessibility measures were developed with the intention of evaluating transport and land use systems, while simultaneously allowing for the ability to measure the effects of proposed plans and investment

21. Furthermore, accessibility has been linked with shortercommutes (Levinson, 1998) and, in areas with high accessibility via public transport, higher incidences of public transport use (Foth et al., 2014; Owen and Levinson, 2015).
22. Two conflicting notions of equity exist, however. To achieve horizontal equity, accessibility should be equally divided across the entire population, regardless of individuals' socio-economic status. Vertical equity, on the other hand, would be achieved when those with the highest need experience the highest accessibility; the concept thus posits that socio-economically vulnerable populations should have higher accessibility (Karner and Niemeier, 2013; Martens, 2017).
23. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on accessibility to jobs in three major ways. Firstly, we move away from the use of arbitrary time limits usually used in cumulative measures of accessibility, and instead compute the average commute to determine the time threshold, thereby more accurately modelling people's activity spheres. Secondly, along with calculating accessibility to all jobs, we also discern accessibility to low-income jobs, and specifically measure the latter for vulnerable groups. Finally, this paper is the first to compare such measures and the consequent equity of the transport and land use interaction across eleven major Canadian metropolitan areas, in order to provide a more holistic view on the equity of public transport provision in Canada.
24. Data and methodology
25. To compute the accessibility to jobs metric, public transport schedules across the eleven cities were gathered in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format from their respective transport agencies.
26. Transit schedules were obtained for March 2017, or, when not available, for the available dates closest to this date. For large metropolitan areas with multiple providers, the schedules from all agencies were obtained with overlapping schedule dates.
27. Transit schedules were subsequently imported into a geographic information system through the Add GTFS to a network dataset add-on for ArcGIS.

29. Results and discussion
30. On average, low-income workers have shorter commutes. This difference is especially profound in Edmonton, where low-income workers travel 10 min less than average, while in London and Kitchener Cambridge-Waterloo, low-wage commuters are forced to travel longer than average, although the difference is not large.
31. Distinct patterns of access can be discerned from the maps: accessibility generally drops off with increasing distance from the central business district, but along rapid transit lines – commuter rail and the subway in Toronto and Montreal, or the Skytrain in Vancouver – accessibility levels, to both low-income jobs and all jobs, remain higher, reflecting the benefits conveyed by fast and frequent modes of transport.

34. There exists, however, considerable tension between the desired detail, required computational methods and ease of communication of varying accessibility metrics.
35. Conclusion
36. This study has developed the metric of accessibility to low-income jobs for vulnerable residents, which, in contrast with commonly used measures of accessibility to all jobs, provides policy makers and urban planners with a more fine-grained tool to examine the effects of new

38. Planners and urban decision makers, and in turn their policy recommendations, can thus benefit greatly from employing more detailed and segmented accessibility metrics.
