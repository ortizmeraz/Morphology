```ad-abstract
This paper summarizes and analyses findings from more than two dozen aggregate and disaggregate studies of travel time (and sometimes money) expenditures, exploring the question of the existence of a constant travel time budget. We conclude (with prior researchers) that travel time expenditures are not constant except, perhaps, at the most aggregate level. Nevertheless, individuals travel time expenditures do show patterns that can be partly explained by measurable characteristics. Travel time expenditure is strongly related to individual and household characteristics (e.g., income level, gender, employment status, and car ownership), attributes of activities at the destination (e.g., activity group and activity duration), and characteristics of residential areas (e.g., density, spatial structure, and level of service). To the extent that travel time expenditures are constant at the aggregate level, the underlying mechanisms explaining that regularity are not well understood. Consequently, further research into explaining travel time and money expenditure patterns is justified.

## Bullet points

1. •	At the extreme, the TTB is viewed almost as a universal constant: 1.1–1.3h per traveler per day (Zahavi and Ryan, 1980; Zahavi and Talvitie, 1980), about 430h per person per year (Hupkes, 1982), 50min to 1.1h per person per day (Bieber et al., 1994), 1.1h per person per day (Schafer and Victor, 2000) or 1.3h per person per day (Vilhelmson, 1999).
2. The travel time minimization principle underlies a great deal of policy-making as well as virtually all regional travel demand forecasting models, and is used to justify monetizing the benefits of transportation improvements on the basis (primarily) of travel time savings.
3. ‘‘What is the most attractive set of activities/destinations I can achieve, given a certain travel time budget?’’ Essentially this observation is attributed to Zahavi by Gunn (1981) and by Michael Wegener as a participant at the European Science Foundation/National Science Foundation Social Change and Sustainable Transport (SCAST) conference at Berkeley, CA, March 10–13, 1999.
4. Thus, the apparent paradox of the TTB concept may be due simply to a failure to make the models realistic enough, rather than to an actual contradiction of the basic principles on which the models are based.
5. In cross-study comparisons, it is desirable to compare results from different studies using similar dimensions. Unfortunately, this is almost impossible to achieve as researchers conducted their studies at different times and with different objectives.
6. **Socioeconomic characteristics**
7. **Age**. More studies have found a significant effect of age on travel time expenditure than studies (Roth and Zahavi, 1981) that found it insignificant. Prendergast and Williams (1981) found that people of middle ages (between 21 and 64) spent more time on traveling than those who are either below school age or above retirement age. Kitamura et al. (1992) found that people between 18 and 50 years old traveled significantly more than people older than 50.
8. **Car ownership**. A clear linkage between travel time expenditure and car ownership often appears, but the direction of such linkage is not consistent.
9. **Employment status**. The influence of employment status (employed vs. unemployed) on travel time expenditure is quite uniform.
10. **Gender**. Gender is another variable for which researchers have found contradictory results. A number of researchers have found that men spend more time traveling than women (Prendergast and Williams, 1981; and more authors… Roth and Zahavi (1981) found no significant difference in travel time expenditure between men and women in Bogota, Columbia and yet in the same study they found men spent more time traveling than women in Singapore.
11. **Gender by employment status**. There may be an interactive effect between gender and employment status on travel time expenditure.
12. **Household size**. Zahavi and his colleagues (1980s) observed that travel time expenditure per person decreased with increasing household size, whereas travel time expenditure per traveler varied little with household size.
13. **Income**. Similar to the influence of car ownership, findings on the influence of income on travel time expenditure do not agree with each other. A positive influence was found by a number of researchers… Tanner (1981) also noted that total travel time expenditures per person per day rose with income, but his results suggest that the positive relationship mainly comes from the positive correlation between time spent in the private auto and income.
14. Reasons for the conflicting results on the relationship between income and travel time expenditure may be similar to those for the conflicting results on car ownership and travel time expenditure.
15. **Area-specific characteristics**
16. **Area type**. The effect of area type on travel time expenditure may be examined by simply dividing the area into urban versus suburban or large metropolitan area versus smaller cities. Van der Hoorn (1979)… found that travel time per person per week was the highest in dense urban areas for all trip purposes except for school. Consequently, total travel time expenditure per person per week was the highest in dense urban areas.
17. Not all researchers support the notion of relatively higher travel times for dense urban areas than for suburban and rural areas. Downes and Morrell (1981) examined travel time expenditures in the inner area, middle area, and outer area of Reading, Britain and found that these area types made little difference in daily travel time per person.
18. Another way to study the effect of area type on travel time is to categorize the area by some attributes such as population density and size. Landrock (1981) studied the effects of population size and population density on the daily travel time expenditure per person in Britain.
19. Another way to study the effect of area type on travel time is to categorize the area by some attributes such as population density and size. Landrock (1981) studied the effects of population size and population density on the daily travel time expenditure per person in Britain.
20. The effect of population density on travel time expenditure seems to be significant and non-linear. The interactive effect of population size and density seems insignificant except for people living in areas of low density but high population, who tended to have higher travel times compared to those living in other areas.
21. Gordon et al. (1989) reasoned that what caused people living in large cities to have higher travel time expenditures than those living in small cities was the spatial structure, not population density. They argued that the relationship between population density and travel time expenditure is ambiguous if spatial structure is ignored. For example, as they noted (p. 140), ‘‘In a monocentric city high densities imply shorter trips, and low densities mean longer trips. In a policentric city, low densities could mean either shorter or longer trips depending upon whether workers choose homes around employment subcenters. . . or whether cross-commuting across metropolitan areas is common.’’
22. Researchers have extensively studied how different spatial designs of neighborhoods affect these measurements (e.g., Cervero, 1995, 1996; Ewing et al., 1994; Frank and Pivo, 1994; Handy, 1996a). Neo-traditional neighborhoods are sometimes referred to as transit-oriented neighborhoods (Ryan and McNally, 1995). Designed to be balanced and self-contained, these communities have mixed land uses for residential, commercial, and recreational opportunities.
23. Results showing fewer automobile trips in neo-traditional neighborhoods certainly imply a ower level of total daily travel time by automobile, although when walk and other non-motor zed trips are included, the total daily travel time may not be lower compared to that in typical suburban neighborhoods.
24. **Time of day**…. departing from work often took place during the peak period when travel speeds were relatively low.
25. **Explanations for a constant travel time budget**
26. Mokhtarian and Salomon (2001). … hypothesize the existence of an unobserved ideal travel time budget, which varies as a function of personality, lifestyle, travel-related attitudes, stage in lifecycle, and other socio-economic and demographic variables.
27. Under this formulation, a stable mean observed travel time budget may result from random deviations on either side of the ideal budgets consistently canceling each other out across the population. Thus, in places where a constant travel time budget is observed empirically, it might be reasonable to assume that the observed travel time budget represents the average unobserved ideal travel time budget.
28. At the aggregate level, travel expenditures initially appear to have some stability. Similar travel time and money budgets may be found within a sub-population (e.g., travelers) and in certain areas. However, empirical studies that examine the existence of travel time and money budgets at different times and locations are often found to give widely different results.
29. The overall conclusion we draw from these studies, then, is that the claim of the definitive existence of constant travel time and money budgets in time and space is not supported. However, we do believe that individual travel time and money expenditures are behavioral phenomena that can productively be modeled as a function of the kinds of variables described above. Several directions for future research appear to be fruitful.
