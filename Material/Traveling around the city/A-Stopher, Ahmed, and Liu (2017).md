## Abstract
The existence of stable personal travel-time expenditure has been debated for more than 40 years. Aggregate research has supported this notion, while disaggregate research has largely failed to find evidence. In this paper, a unique data set containing multiday GPS measurements of travel time expenditures over a period from 5 to 8 years is used to examine the evidence for stable daily personal travel-time expenditures. The evidence from this study adds further support to the notion that people expend a stable amount of travel time over a period as long as 8 years, and the average level of such expenditure accords almost exactly with that claimed over the years from aggregate studies. 
## Bullet points
1. This study provides further evidence that the average expenditure of travel time is around an hour per person per day, as postulated by many researchers over the past 40 years (Ahmed and Stopher 2014). In this case, however, a disaggregate study indicates this, whereas almost all such indications previously have come only from aggregate studies. In addition, this is one of the first studies to determine this value from the more accurate data of GPS devices, than from more error-prone diaries and interviews.
2. Even where there are significant differences in average daily travel time expenditures, there are no signs of a trend, such as a gradual decrease or a gradual increase in average travel time expenditures.
3. The evidence to date is sufficient to cast serious question over the use of travel-time savings as a measure of benefit from transport projects. If a budget truly exists, then travel time saved by a specific project is likely to show up as increased travel elsewhere and at other times, hence raising questions about the validity of considering travel-time savings to be a benefit of transport system improvements and policy changes, a conclusion reached by other researchers also.
4. Furthermore, if the goal of transport investment is to manage or reduce congestion, then many of the approaches taken today, which are based on the assumption that people attempt to minimise travel time, are inappropriate and should be replaced.
