```ad-abstract
Technology has indispensably been a part of the city evolution throughout history. In recent years, there has been a shift in the pattern of development in smart cities, where smart cities attempt to embrace practices of sustainability using Information and Communication Technologies and other smart solutions. Past studies reveal that these smart cities have failed in successfully incorporating sustainable development goals into their smart strategies, where they tend to focus more on achieving smartness goals rather than sustainability goals and targets. This paper presents a multifaceted interrogative study on several ongoing smart city initiatives around the globe that supports United Nations Urban Sustainability Agenda. This paper aims to focus on harmonizing smart and sustainable city initiatives with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals using a systems thinking approach. The study develops conceptual models that support the city transition into being a sustainable smart city. These conceptual models were designed based on the fundamentals of system thinking for a system of several elements under the key catalyzers “Policy and Governance,” “Research & Development,” and “Partnership.” The causalities and interrelationships among elements in developed conceptual models justify the dynamicity and the impact of these elements within a system. The outcome of this research paper would support industry experts, policymakers, and city planners to adopt robust policy interventions and best practices for developing strategies that support the transition of smart cities to the futuristic label of sustainable cities.

2. With the emerging sustainability threats on cities, it is essential to upgrade even the highly sophisticated support systems, deployed technologies, and existing infrastructures (Hamman, Anquetin, & Monicolle, 2017). This calls for the replacement of the existing infrastructures and city services, where such changes are felt necessary.
3. Smart city strategies and initiatives with an eye for SUD needs to be promoted to combat these challenges (Martosa, Pacheco-Torresa, Ordóñeza, & Jadraque-Gagoa, 2016).
4. ...although cities have diversified their objectives in achieving these SDGs, it is highly unclear how the undertaken smart city initiatives by different countries contribute to achieving SDGs in the long run.
5. This opens the door to integrated systems thinking approach. System dynamic and system thinking approaches are thus often regarded as the most appropriate method in troubleshooting problems (Sterman, 2000).
6. the systems-thinking approach acts as catalysts in integrating all the dimensions of the smart city, covering all the themes and sub-themes addressed under each smart city initiative.
7. The key objectives of this study can be summarized in the following points:
8. Investigate the extent to which several smart city initiatives around the globe interweave the sustainability and SUD themes in their proposed strategies.
9. Harmonize smart city initiatives with UN SDGs using a system thinking approach, to emphasize systems thinking as the most efficient tool in providing a possible feedback mechanism to unwind several challenges that arise in the urban ecosystem.
10. Analyze key catalyzers that stay as supporting plugins for bridging the existing gap and interlinking smart city initiatives with other possible SDGs

12. LITERATURE REVIEW
13. Smart city initiatives
14. The phrase “smart city” has transpired to address several challenges and possibilities in urban planning and city development for a vast majority of the population across several disciplines.
15. The primary objective of these initiatives is to transform cities into being smarter, greener, and sustainable, which means a better quality of life to the citizens and increased economic opportunities.

17. Smart cities and systems thinking
18. These smart city initiatives are often assumed to be a successful approach in curbing possible city challenges.
19. Systems thinking provides a broader understanding of how a system functions by investigating the relations and changes within the system.
20. The smart city challenges are often perceived as a product of structured relations between selective parameters addressing these challenges, rather than just identifying causes and behavioral changes separately like the traditional linear thinking. These parameters are considered as a part of the city holistically, or pillars that address the challenges of the city, where the smart city is seen as an integration of systems (Dirks & Keeling, 2009).
21. Systems theory has recently been used to formalize smart city visions by playing a vital role in strategic city planning.
22. Page 7
23. System theory outweighs all other tools, because of its systematic behavior in integrating systems, the ability to predict composite changes within the system, and understanding the relevance of possible divergence.
24. Systems thinking addressed in the smart cities context considers socioeconomic and environmental characteristics and their dependencies with several systems and subsystems (Shmelev & Shmeleva, 2018).
25. Why systems thinking and how it works
26. Cities are often considered as complex systems (Berkowitz, Nilon, & Hollweg, 2003; Mora, Bolici, & Deakin, 2017; Portugali, 2016). These systems constitute several subsystems that are interconnected and interrelated with each other to perform specific functions (Bertalanffy, 1976).
27. Functions are often related, and they tie-in connecting several elements within the system.
28. Page 8
29. ... understanding these functions helps us in associating various elements and processes that are essential in filling these functions and facilitates us with a broader understanding of the results obtained when these functions are filled.
30. applying systems thinking to understand these functions act as a potential leverage point since, systems thinking identifies necessities (Onat, Kucukvar, Halog, & Cloutier, 2017), possible knowledge gaps, correlations, and goals.
31. “Systems thinking” is thus an answer to all these questions and challenges, where systems thinking acts as a support toolin addressing complexities, uncertainties, and identifying “what if” impacts (Onat et al., 2017). Systems thinking interconnects several elements of a system to the point of interest, better identified as a purpose.
32. The conventional planning model of the city's transportation network would hold “transportation” as its prime focus.
33. Systems thinking provides a broader understanding of how a system functions by investigating the relations and changes within the system.
34. Novelty statement and research gap
35. The comprehensive review revealed that only a handful of articles attempted to arrange and describe possible interactions between the key drivers/elements of the smart city at a strategic level.
36. the literature review saw the lack of a considerable amount of tools to understand the dynamic behavior of elements under system interaction. Although several implementation tools such as the Kitemark recognition and progress monitoring tools exist in the literature, neither of them attempts to consider the interdependencies between the socio-economic, environmental, and numerous subsystems that form the basis of any sustainable urban planning model.
37. Systems thinking as a tool presented in this study facilitates impeccable legitimacy of judgments for intercession and a collaborative approach to support decision making in smart cities.
38. Page 9
39. System theory out weighs all other tools, because of its systematic behavior in integrating systems, the ability to predict composite changes within the system, and understanding the relevance of feasible divergence. Systems thinking addressed in context with smart cities considers socioeconomic and environmental characteristics and their dependencies with several systems and subsystems in a model that helps in strategic city planning (Shmelev & Shmeleva, 2018). This paves ways to SUD in smart cities (Pretorius et al., 2014).

41. Visvizi and Lytras (2018) highlight the importance of proper policy measures in transforming cities to be smarter and more sustainable. Figure 2 shows a causal feedback loop diagram to explain the catalyzer role of policy & governance for the successful implementation of SDGs.
42. ... participation in governance and decision making will have a positive influence on the involvement of the city residents in political activities (Alghais, Pullar, & Charles-Edwards, 2018). This increases the community-based interrelatedness. This, in turn, facilitates opportunities for male and female representatives to engage in the policy & governance system, thus reinforcing the participation in governance & decision making via reinforcing loop R1; see Figure 2.

44. DISCUSSION
45. Results show that although smart city strategies have echoed the inclusion of sustainability goals in their smart agenda, in practice, cities have not adopted these goals to its full potentialin addressing future city challenges in several possible domains. The authors have adopted a system-thinking approach to unwind several possible causal relations in real-world cases, where a CFLD was conceptualized since, experimental methods often hold complexities when practically applied in real-time situations.

47. CONCLUDING REMARKS
48. A multi-level policy and governance framework that includes; civil society, multiple stakeholders, public and private sectors, investors, and digitally and sustainably enabled landscape is felt necessary.
49. Cities must tap into creating a smart plan that includes engagement with universities, research centers, non-profit organizations,

51. For any smart city initiative to be successful, the authors have suggested the adoption of the 4I's while implementing smart strategies to support city transition. The elements of the “4I's strategy implementation pyramid” developed by the authors include:
	1. Innovation: Digital innovation provides opportunities for cities to embrace sustainability practices by tackling several social, economic, and environmental challenges. Smart cities are platforms that utilize technological innovation in testing several innovative strategies and approaches. Innovation brings in reliable alternatives to compact smart city-related challenges.
	2. Investment: Investments are often considered as keystones in fostering innovation in smart cities. Smart city investments are often income-generating, and they facilitate sufficient funding for city maintenance and another day to day operations of cities by generating sufficient cash flow along with several economic benefits.
	3. Inclusion: Social disparities and exclusions are some of the development challenges that cities face. A socially inclusive frame work supporting smart strategies is important in steering economic growth and prosperity.
	4. Improvement: Continuous improvement programs are often important to ensure the quality and sustainability of several production and consumption practices and services offered in cities such as healthcare, sanitation, infrastructure, transportation, water supply, and so forth.
