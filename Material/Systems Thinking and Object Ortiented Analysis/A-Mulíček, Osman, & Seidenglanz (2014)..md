2. Timespace concepts developed in the field of theoretical physics are difficult to integrate into the theoretical research conducted in the social sciences.
3. Current discourse regarding the relation of time and space in contemporary social theory thus generally bypasses the timespace routines of everydayness, although it is precisely at this point on the scale that perhaps the most obvious spatialization of time takes place, either by means of a multiplicity of duration, cycles and rhythms and their reflections in the form of social or physical structures.

5. The multiplicity of overlapping rhythms as manifested at a particular location by the emergence of spatially and functionally contextualized temporality is supplemented with examples of transport, retail and work rhythms in the city
6. As such, it stems from the specific geographical, social and economic attributes of a specific location, the seasonal nature of activities and local heritage (Levine, 1997; Urry, 1995).
7. It is often referred to as the time of industrial capitalism, in which productivity is not measured by tasks completed but by the duration of working time

9. Time content is also an important constitutional element of place for Nigel Thrift and Donald Parks, who refer to timing space, generated according to how time is treated within that space.
10. This corresponds to Giddens’s characterization of social life as a reciprocal presence and absence, i.e. availability and unavailability. Giddens discusses the traditional notion of place and, alluding to the concept of locale, provides an interconnection between place and its immediate time space context (Giddens 1985).

12. Massey describes the city as an open timespace system of social relationships composed of partial subsystems and linking various groups and activities, emphasizing that most urban activities are not projects conducted by a single individual.
13. In order to be implemented efficiently, a number of activities require coordination between multiple projects both in terms of time (synchronization) and place (synchorization). The aggregation of partial timespace rhythms of individuals present at typical locations in typical times (at home during the night, in the workplace during the day, etc.) may help establish a specific place temporality, which stems from a rhythmical presence/absence of people and activities (Parkes and Thrift, 1975).
14. Chronotope
15. While the term chronotope was originally associated with the theory of relativity, it was first used in the context of the social sciences by the Russian philosopher and literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin.

17. He emphasizes that an individual is not capable of seeing him/herself as a whole – each individual needs the others in order to understand him/herself (Holloway and Kneale, 2000: 73–74). Bakhtin refers to this mutuality as a dialogue, characterized by a constant interaction between meanings (Folch-Serra, 1990:  259–261). Utilizing a similar dialogic logic framework, Bakhtin also refers to the mutuality of time and space, as he deems it impossible to understand place without time and time without place (Bakhtin, 2002: 15–16).
18. The chronotope was first utilized in geography in the 1990s by Mireya Folch-Serra. Folch-Serra focuses on Bakhtin’s self, dialogically constituted thanks to the others, highlighting the interpretation of each statement from a dual perspective of the self and others and utilizing it in order to establish methods for the  study of landscapes, regions and places. Space is thusconstructed from the  perspective of continuous dialogic interaction on the part of various statements, speeches, voices – a specific chronotope based on the current ratio of opposing centripetal (monologic) and centrifugal (dialogic) forces (Folch-Serra, 1990: 255–258).

20. The most systematic geographic application of the chronotope to date has been developed by Mike Crang. Crang considers three basic issues: the space in question, the time and the relationship between them.
21. Crang comes quite close to Lefebvre’s concept of the thing as a kind of polyrhythmicity. Crang’s concept thus makes direct allusions to Bakhtin’s chronotope and Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis and attempts to integrate the two. Time is not considered empty and linear time as something which enters into situations and influences them, time as something suitable for certain events but not for others, he term topos is used with similar sensitivity for descriptions of place.
22. In other words, time and space only become in a specific joint timespace (Crang,2005: 214).
23. Urban time policies research, most developed in Italian context, employs basically similar theoretical conceptualization of chronotope. Referring implicitly to Lefebvres’s ‘polyrhythmia’ Mareggi (2002) or Bonfiglioli (1997) perceives chronotope as a multi-scalar concept closely linked to urban everydayness.

25. Based on Crang’s concept of the chronotope as a unique combination of a specific place and specific time, it is possible to perform a regionalization of urban space according to the nature of its temporality. Places may be understood as specifically timing space.

27. This text employs the event-time pacemaker concept, referring to the typical duration of activities. It will therefore not focus on the arrival times of public transportation in the studied locality, office opening times, shop closing times or when the sun goes down, but instead on the duration of the interval between two successive departures of public transportation, the duration of a typical shopping session, the duration of a stop light exchange or the average duration of any activity taking place in the studied locality.

29. The rhythms and pacemakers selected for detailed analysis constitute a mere sample of the immense set of hundreds of biological, social, economic, psychological, technological, climatic, astronomical and other rhythms and their resources which together form the polyrhythmicity of the everyday. Rather than providing a comprehensive description, the three selected pacemakers are designed to suggest different ways of thinking about the time of a place.

31. While a spatial region is defined by a set of places which are formally similar or functionally interconnected, rhythms create boundaries in the realm of linear time. Unlike the concept of region, which presupposes the parallel existence of other regions outside its borders, the concept of rhythm does not assume any ‘parallel worlds of activities’ but – in a continuous flow of time – arranges them into an continually (though variably) developing loop.

33. The chronotopic approach to the structuring of timespace is essentially based on the description and analysis of cyclical change. Change – most frequently determined by alternating states of presence and absence of individuals and associated processes and activities – serves to animate the urban place. Unlike the prevailing concept of place as something static (i.e. unchanging in time), the animated place reflects the everyday-urban reality in a much more convincing manner.
