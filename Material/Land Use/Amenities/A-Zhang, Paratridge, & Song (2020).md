```ad-abstract
Studies in the regional innovation literature have largely focused on the role of economic, structural, demographic, and institutional factors, but very few studies shed light on the role of amenities. This paper investigates this question by examining how amenities shape the geography of innovation in China. The empirical results based on city-level data suggest that both natural and consumer amenities are positively associated with regional innovation. Specifically, amenities related to air quality, sunshine, public transportation, educational resources, and healthcare services matter most. Further, the analysis suggests the influence of amenities on innovation is closely linked to city characteristics such as income, density, and human capital. Therefore, to formulate innovation-driven growth, these results suggest that more attention should be paid to the role of amenities and amenity-related strategies should be tailored to city characteristics.

## Bullet points
1. this paper aims to explore the question of whether amenities play a role in determining the geography of innovation in China.
2. In the modern world, innovation has been typically emphasized as a key path to prosperity. Then, how a region breaks with existing knowledge system and introduces new ideas, products, and services is a question of policy significance. So far, many researchers have examined the innovation process by appraising the relative motors of regional innovation output.
3. Being a key factor behind quality of life, amenities are defined as site- or region-specific goods and services that affect regional attractiveness for its workforce (Mulligan and Carruthers 2011).
4. While China is still considered a developing country, over the past 30 years, its economy has experienced the same type of changes that led to amenity-driven migration and growth in more developed countries.
5. **rivers of regional innovation: literature review**
6. Yet, merely R&D efforts and human capital are by no means sufficient to explain regional-level innovative performance. An extensive literature has shed light on the role of other socioeconomic, demographic, and institutional factors.
7. Concentration of people and economic activities is supposedly helpful in terms of accelerating the transmission of information. – See [[Castells]].
8. The effectiveness of agglomeration economies in creating a supportive context for generating new knowledge has also been documented by ample empirical evidence (e.g., Gordon and McCann 2005; Fitjar and Rodríguez-Pose 2015; Rodríguez-Pose and Crescenzi 2008; Kafouros et al. 2015; Crescenzi and Jaax 2017).
9. As highlighted by several authors, institutional conditions and demographical and social factors have made the relationship between innovative efforts and the generation of new knowledge far from a linear process (Agrawal et al. 2008; Rodríguez-Pose and Crescenzi 2008; Kafouros et al. 2015; Smit et al. 2015; Rong et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017).
10. **But**
11. … utilizing 2013–2015 US census block data, Zandiatashbar and Hamidi (2018) find that amenities (related to transit service quality and walkability) along with diversity and tolerance are significant influential factors of local knowledge economy in the USA.
12. Amenities affect innovation activities by helping to retain and attract skilled workers.
13. Many empirical studies support such an amenity growth strategy. For example, Glaeser et al. (2001), Adamson et al. (2004) find a positive association between amenities and city growth. Li et al. (2016) suggest that high-growth firms exist in counties with higher educational attainment and more natural amenities.
14. Conversely, the opposite applies when there are disamenities. For example, according to the psychology literature, exposure to ambient air pollution reduces cognitive ability, as well as increases anxiety and boredom (Lavy et al. 2014; Pun et al. 2017).
15. The dependent variable proxies for innovation intensity are per-capita patent applications,3 which have been accepted as the most appropriate measure of innovation performance (e.g., Mansfield 1986; Griliches 1990; Hagedoorn and Cloodt 2003; Mate-Sanchez-Val and Harris 2014).
16. To reveal the overall amenities for each prefecture city, we construct two composite indexes for natural amenities and consumer amenities by means of principal component analysis (PCA).
17. Regarding each individual consumer amenity, only those related to healthcare services, educational resources, and public transportation have a significant effect. However, if there is collinearity among the amenity indicators, we should not exclude the possibility that the statistically insignificant amenity variables shown in columns (1)–(7) could still be significant determinants of regional innovation.12 Columns (8)–(10) report the results using principal components’ natural amenity index and consumer amenity index that use all of the amenity variables in their construction. These results show a strong statistically positive relationship between the indexes and regional innovation.
18. Local educational resources in primary and middle schools and healthcare resources remain salient factors in determining patenting innovation. This implies that patenting innovation is positively linked to a city’s educational resources for primary and secondary school students. We believe one of the main reasons for this pattern is the type of highly educated workers critical to innovation are also parents who value educational quality for their children.
19. Generally, this paper finds that amenities along with other drivers of innovation such as R&D inputs, stock of human capital, and agglomeration economies are all the impetus of regional innovation, and their effects interact with one another. In particular, while agglomeration economies and amenities are not direct inputs in knowledge creation, they appear to stimulate the input–output efficiency in its creation.
20. Second, differentiated amenity-related strategies or city-based policies are recommended for innovation development. For instance, for relatively developed cities, the role of amenities should receive more emphasis, as the influence of amenities on innovation is larger in these areas. Also, reducing city disamenity factors such as air pollution appears to also promote local innovation. In contrast, the policies for innovation development for poorer, less developed cities should focus on other fundamental drivers of innovation— e.g., R&D and human capital investment. However, even lagging cities that are well endowed with natural amenities can better utilize their assets to attract innovative workers.
21. Finally, this paper has some limitations that merit further research. First, more proxy measures of innovation should be considered to assess whether the results are robust. … Second, due to data availability, this paper did not directly test the underlying mechanisms by examining how individual migration decisions are affected by amenities. Instead, the results confirm a positive association between skills and amenities that is consistent with that proposition, though we did incorporate instrumental variable approaches that increase our confidence.
