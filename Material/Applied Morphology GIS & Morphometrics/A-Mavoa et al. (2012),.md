```ad-abstract
There is relatively little research on accessibility using public transit as the travel mode. Yet understanding public transit accessibility is important for encouraging mode shifts to reduce car reliance and is essential for the wellbeing of non-car households. The paper describes two measures of public transit access. The first is a combined public transit and walking accessibility index, which measures potential access to destinations via public transit and walking modes. The second is a transit frequency measure, which is a measure of transit service level in an area. These two measures extend current public transit accessibility measures by including all components of the public transit journey, calculating accessibility at the parcel level and providing a measure of public transit service. Results for the Auckland region show that although 94.4% of the urban population live in areas with medium–high public transit and walking access, only 26.5% of the urban population also have an average transit frequency of two or more trips per hour per stop. Moreover, only 5% of the urban population live in areas with an average transit frequency of more than four services per hour per stop. This work highlights the importance of including measures of transit frequency when investigating public transit access. The results also reveal the potential to use these measures to gain a more complete and realistic picture of public transit access and to explore the potential for mode substitution and accessibility for non-car households.

## Bullet points 
1. Yet, accessibility by public transit modes is becoming increasingly important for two reasons. First, high levels of car travel and car dependence can have detrimental effects on both our physical health and the environment (Litman, 2003; Shannon et al., 2006). Increasing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions (Litman, 2003), traffic congestion (Litman, 1999), traffic accidents (Litman, 2003), oil price vulnerability, and physical inactivity and obesity related disorders (Sallis et al., 2004) have all been associated with increasing levels of car use. Reducing car travel to mitigate these negative effects is unlikely unless the destinations of daily life can be readily accessed via other transport modes. Thus it is important to understand whether destinations are accessible using public transit.
2. A second reason for the importance of public transit accessibility relates to equity issues. …. The relative vulnerability of the public transit-reliant population – youth, elderly, marginalized – is the reason that Martin et al. (2008) have called for more attention to be paid to the incorporation of public transit into accessibility modeling.
3. We have addressed this question by creating a measure of public transit and walking access to a range of destinations that represent places that people travel to in everyday life.
4. Lei and Church (2010) provide a good review of past accessibility research in general and accessibility with respect to transit in particular. Here, we only review accessibility with respect to transit. We categorize existing accessibility measures into three categories: (1) access to transit stops, (2) duration of public transit journey, and (3) access to destinations via public transit.
5. Most studies of accessibility that include public transit focus on physical access, that is proximity to a transit stop (Biba et al., 2010; Currie, 2010; Furth et al., 2007; Gutierrez and Garcia-Palomares, 2008; Hsiao et al., 1997; Kimpel et al., 2007; Lovett et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2003).
6. An essential element in modeling access to transit stops is the distance that people walk to get to a stop. Researchers have typically used walking distances similar to planners’ rule of thumb of 400 m (0.25 mile) and 800 m (0.5 mile) for estimating the distance people will walk to a transit stop or station (El-Geneidy et al., 2009; Hess, 2009; Hsiao et al., 1997; Kimpel et al., 2007; Lovett et al., 2002) although other distances have also been used (e.g. 300 m (Mondou, 2001), 500 m (Chapleau and Morency, 2005)).
7. it is also important to know the places people can subsequently reach when traveling by public transit. Therefore it is important to focus not only on physical access, but to include the time taken to travel between the origin and destination (Lei and Church, 2010).
8. Only recently has there been additional work in this area with Benenson et al. (2009) proposing an approach to accessibility using a detailed transportation network in Israel. Their work includes street driving time estimates, bus lines, bus stops and bus departure and arrival times, as well as real world estimates of travel speed reflecting time and location dependent congestion.
9. The above studies measure access to locations via public transit, but do not consider the types of destinations present at these locations. As noted in the definition above, access to different activities/opportunities is an important component of overall accessibility. It goes beyond considering just the accessibility of the transportation network – i.e. the ease of getting to a place (Curtis and Scheurer, 2010).
10. Travel time is also used as a measure of access. Burns and Inglis (2007) create a cost surface to determine the travel cost (time) to supermarkets and fast food outlets. They calculate travel time cost for three different modes: car, bus and walking. The bus travel cost is modeled based on the road type and frequency of buses along the road.
