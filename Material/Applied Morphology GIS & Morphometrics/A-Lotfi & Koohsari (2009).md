```ad-abstract
The subject of urban quality of life and the promotion of its concept in particular, has always been the central focus of urban designers. This term is a multi-conceptual and dimensions. However most of the scholars have agreed that the concept consisted from two main dimensions; objective and subjective which these two approaches are used for its measuring. One of the important goals of urban designers is to create urban environment that all citizens have easy access to urban services, as accessibility reflects the quality of an urban environment. The present research intends to measure the public space accessibility by using objective approach in first and then by using the subjective approach for measuring in the study area to compare the results. The results revealed that there are considerable differences between objective and subjective measuring of urban quality of life in a urban space, therefore urban designers can not rely only on the results of objective measuring to understand such spaces for planning, if so, their attitudes towards urban spaces could not be an appropriate guide for explaining the quality of life for urban residents.

2. The term of quality of life has no a clear origin and there is not an overall adopted definition despite its high attraction.
3. The concept has several interesting attributes (Szalai 1980): (1) it refers to human life only, (2) it is rarely if ever used in the plural, (3) it is used as a single indivisible generic term whose meaning can be clarified, and (4) it is difficult to classify into any discrete category of related social sciences.

5. Whatever the term used, a person’s quality of life is dependent on the exogenous (objective) facts of his or her life and the endogenous (subjective) perception he or she has of these factors and of himself or herself. Today modern approaches such as new-urbanism emphasizes on the neighborhood units in urban design and concentrates on the renovation and rehabilitation of such units in the cities (CNU 2000).
6. This study tries to fill the gap between these two quality of life analyzes by investigating the accessibility in the neighborhoods to clarify the importance of two aspects as city is a physical-social phenomenon. The main aims of the research are as follow:
	1. A review of the importance of accessibility to urban public spaces.
	2. Objective and subjective measuring accessibility to neighborhood facilities.
	3. Comparing and analyzing the results of two different approaches, measuring of urban quality of life.

8. Carmona outlined that in broad terms, the public realm includes all the spaces accessible to and used by the public including external public spaces such as public squares, streets, etc. and internal public space such as libraries, museums, etc. and finally external and internal quasi-public space such as university campuses, sports grounds, etc. (Carmona 2003, p. 110).
9. Public space represents the material location where the social interactions and political activities of all members of the public occur. Lefebvre (1991) argues that spaces are shaped through the interaction of the built environment with spatial practices and representations of space and every society in its history has shaped a distinctive social space that meets its intertwined requirements for economic production and social production.
10. According to new urbanist theory, public space strengthen resident interaction and promote sense of community: (1) integrating private residential space with surrounding public space, and (2) careful design and placement of public space.
11. Accessibility to public spaces could be one of the important factors which include the physical dimension of the spaces. This dimension can have considerable effects on the other aspects of the spaces.

13. Accessibility refers to the ease with which building, place or facility can be reached by people and/or goods and services (Cowan 2005, p. 2).
14. Accessibility is also especially significant for the consideration of spatial equity issues (Talen 1998). The issues of spatial equity of urban public facilities have prospered during the past two decades (Davis 1968; Rich 1979; Jones and Kirby 1982; Kirby et al. 1983; Pinch 1984; Smith 1994; Hay 1995; Erkip 1997; Talen and Anselin 1998; Ogryczak 2000; Pasaogullari and Doratli 2004; Tsou et al. 2005). Erkip (1997) argues that for most of the fixed urban services such as parks, libraries and public health facilities, physical proximity is required. Pinch (1985) suggests that such ‘point-specific’ services create a tapering effect because of travel costs together with time and effort, all of which tend to increase with distance.
15. ... from social point of view the level of objective accessibility to services should be considered for all citizens. Also, the importance of physical accessibility to urban facilities should not be underestimated;

17. The difficulties in measuring equality of service outcome, received services may be valued differently by varying groups (Walker 1981). Proximity does not guarantee utilization (Cromley and McLafferty 2002, p. 235). An individual can choose not to utilize a particular service, avoid all care, travel to further services, or choose a different type of service (Hare and Barcus 2007, p. 183).
18. in a digital world, accessibility in urban space combines with virtual accessibility, in what is now being called ‘‘hybrid’’ space (Couclelis and Arthur 2000; Scott 2000 from Audirac 2002, p. 217). In hybrid space, accessibility has to do with reachability (reaching an activity at a location by using physical or virtual means of transportation or communication), obtainability (personal skills and capabilities to be able to make use of an opportunity in physical or virtual space)
19. There can be raised a question that does the new virtual spaces influence and decrease the importance of physical accessibility? If so, is there a need for considering the matter? It can be discussed that the issue is important for two major reasons and should be evaluated in accessibility.

21. The present study intends to measure the level of accessibility to the local facilities (parks, primary schools and shops) three basic perspectives on the measurement of accessibility are identified (Geurs and Ritsema van Eck 2003, p. 70):
	1. Infrastructure-based measures describe the level of service in transport infrastructure. Typical measures are level of congestion and average traveling speed on the road network.
	2. Activity-based measures describe the level of access to spatially distributed activities. Activity-based measures can be subdivided into: (a) potential-accessibility measures, analyzing accessibility on the macrolevel (b) Time—space measures, in which accessibility is analyzed at the microlevel.
	3. Utility-based measures focus on the (economic) benefits people derive from access to spatially distributed activities. There are five classes of factors affecting the measure of access. Talen (2003) listed these factors in ****Table 1****

24. Since this research intends to measure objective accessibility in local scale, the modes of travel consider pedestrian accessibility by selecting blocks centroids as points of origin which it could help the importance of pedestrian access in this study. This research considers the local facilities as points of destinations. Also, travel route characteristics could be used for measuring but they have been excluded due to shortage of up to date and exact data. The network analysis was used to calculate the distances between origin and destination.
	1. Points of origin and destination. Points of origin are geometric census blocks centroids and points of destination include local shops, parks and primary schools.
	2. Weighting of census blocks. The Census blocks (points of origins) were weighted for the level of accessibility to local facilities according to the calculated distances. We have used minimum distance approach in this research and weighted criteria by using fuzzy logic. In this research we assumed the distances, \800 as appropriated places (full fuzzy) and the places with more than 1,200 m distances as inappropriate (fuzzyless) and finally the linear threshold function was used for assign fuzziness of distances between 800 and 1,200 m (following equation).

	4. Measuring accessibility index for neighborhoods. Population index of each census blocks was used to assign their scores of neighborhood’s accessibility. Interval values could be assigned in any number of classes and could be based on standard deviations, quintiles, natural breaks, and so on. As mentioned, subjective assessment approach is usually including field studies such as questionnaire and interview to understand urban resident tendencies and mental imagination. Accessibility varies among the different people in different times; low income, disabled, elderly and children have the least access to services. Since, these groups are usually unable to use car, distance is a key factor to services accessibility.
25. Kenyon et al. (2002) defined mobility-related exclusion as the process by which people are prevented from participating in the economic, political and social life of the community because of reduced accessibility to opportunities, services and social networks, due in whole or in part to insufficient mobility in a society and environment built around the assumption of high mobility.

29. The accessibility indexes were calculated in two scales; census blocks and neighborhoods. The origins, for which access is calculated, consisted of 1,507 census block centroids. The destinations, which included local stores, elementary schools, and local parks,

31. **6 Conclusion**
32. Quality of an object is depended to its advantage or disadvantage compared to another one which is perceived by man through objective and subjective ways. The quality of an object originates from two sources; ego and object itself which are called value and measuring scale respectively, they indicate two groups of qualities of desirability and qualities of capacity of objects (Alexander 1970).
33. The quality of urban space could be measured on the base of subjective and objective strategy by using qualitative and quantitative data. Subjective assessment approach is usually including field studies such as questionnaire and interview to understand urban resident tendencies and mental imagination.

35. Urban designers should be aware that the results of these two measuring approaches are not always same.
36. This research has revealed that understanding the existed status of an urban place (like neighborhood) is insufficient by relying only on the results of objective approach.
37. The mere objective approach has been the main cause of urban development failure in many Third world countries. The plans which seemed to be quiet rational in the view of urban designers, now are stored in the shelf of urban administrative offices as they ignored the preferences and imaginations of people. Urban spaces are an outcome of continuous relations between the urban physic and the users which forms through a social process.
38. It is quiet necessary that designers have to provide a framework for measuring the quality of life in the urban spaces while they investigate the urban objective accessibility also they should create an appropriate skill for measuring subjective accessibility with respect to different age and sex group characteristics.
