In recent years, several systems and **tools** to assess energy consumption and carbon emissions at scales beyond that of merely buildings, **such as LEED, CASBEE and BREEAM** communities have been development. However, **reviews reveal a lack of robustness in these methods both in terms of an unstructured mix of qualitative and quantitative criteria and lack of focus on urban form parameters found to influence energy consumption and carbon emissions**. A promising **quantitative assessment system** including various urban form indicators is **developed by the Urban Morphology Institute (UMI) in Paris**. Within the research **centre on zero emission neighbourhoods in smart cities (ZEN), a GIS-based method is applied to analyze conditions of urban form known to contribute to carbon emissions**. In this paper we demonstrate how a selection of the UMI indicators describing proximity can be further specified applying GIS-based methods. The potential of applicability of urban assessment system in planning as well as design processes will increase when linked to tools that are already implemented, and map visualizations as well as data provided by these methods are highly applicable in planning and urban design. As further research, methods described in recent research within ZEN and specified measures for calculating UMI indicators, will be tested in analyses of urban development areas in Norway.

## Bullet points
1. a GIS-based method is applied to analyze conditions of urban form known to contribute to carbon emissions. Specific urban form variables related to building morphology, building densities and spatial properties of street networks are identified, mapped and analyzed in a comparative study of three design options of an urban development area in Trondheim.
2. The method reveals significant differences between the design options and seem to be highly applicable in the assessment of urban planning options to optimize urban form and reduce carbon emissions, but further research is needed to evaluate more closely which topics and measures should be included.
3. Human density, Building density, Surface occupied by pedestrian and bicycle paths, Surface occupied by road network, Connectivity of the pedestrian/bike grid, Cyclomatic complexity of the pedestrian/bike grid, Average distance between intersections in the bike/pedestrian grid, Proportion of the population more than 300 meters away from a public transport stop, Number of public transport modes accessible within 300 meters, Hydrological intensity, calculated as the percent of natural hydrological functions preserved or restored, Proportion of green fabric.
4. GISs methods currently being developed holds a potential to support assessment systems for urban sustainability in terms of providing informative thematic maps for visualizations in different scales. In addition, GIS-based methods can be implemented to further specify which measures to apply.
