```ad-abstract
A spatial modelling method is presented that utilizes a Geographical Information System (GIS) to combine the analyses of three constituent elements of urban form recognized by M. R. G. Conzen. The aim is to reduce a spatial classification system for various types of urban areas, and reveal how they perform socio-economically. In the proposed method, space syntax, spacematrix, and mixed-use index (MXI) are used to assess street-network integration, building density, and land-use mixture. These elements are incorporated into a single framework. The validity of the method is initially tested through human behaviour records based on Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking. The method is then used in a comparison of the various spatial parameters of three new towns and one old town in the Netherlands. The results show that the old town has higher values of street network integration, building density, and land-use mixture than the new towns. The method functions well as a diagnostic tool for suggesting ways of improving socio-economic performance in urban areas. For example a spatial diagnosis can be made for new towns suffering from a lack of vibrant street life. The method helps to reveal the interdependences of street-network integration, building density, and land-use mixture in urban transformation processes.

## Bullet points
1. Improved computing capacity has contributed to great advances in existing methods, such as space syntax, spacematrix, and mixed-use index (MXI). Meanwhile, the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as a tool for combining large amounts of place-specific socio-economic data is slowly entering urban research.
2. None of the various methods developed so far can individually provide a complete picture of the spatial properties of the built environment.
3. ‘New towns’ are defined as planned towns constructed over a short time span, often corresponding to a particular spatial structure and architectural style. However, the socioeconomic outcome in these towns often turns out to be different from that expected: lack of street life, limited economic investment and monofunctional areas are evident.
4. In contrast, ‘old towns’ developed over a longer time period often have centres with vibrant street life adjacent to well-functioning residential areas.
5. Computer programs such as Depthmap can be used to analyse the street network configuration according to metric distance (measuring shortest-length paths), topological distance (measuring fewest-turn paths), and geometric distance (measuring least-angular-change paths) (Hillier and Iida, 2005, pp. 557-8). P 100
6.  **Methodology applied**
7.  The main routes through and between urban areas are highlighted in an angular analysis with a high metric radius, whereas the various local centres are highlighted in an angular analysis with a low metric radius (Nes and Stolk, 2012). Angular analysis with a low topological radius is used here because a high radius analysis tends to overestimate street integration values.
8. The value of each grid cell is determined by the highest value of axial lines inside the grid. All measurements are separated into high, medium and low values using the ArcGIS natural break method.
	1. The most integrated areas (shown in red in Figure 1) contain high values for both topological and metric radii.
9. Building density and various building types can be represented simultaneously using the spacematrix method.
	1. The floor space index ([[FSI]]) on the y-axis gives an indication of an area’s built intensity or plot ratio. The ground space index ([[GSI]]) on the x-axis indicates the building coverage or ground-floor area.
	2. The classification of various building forms is based on the correlation between [[FSI]] and [[GSI]], thereby more accurately reflecting the attributes of the built-mass.
10. The MXI quantifies the degree of land-use mixture (Hoek, 2009). It measures the functional mix, based on the percentages of gross floor area of dwellings, working places, and commercial amenities occupying all the floors of the urban blocks.
11. Combining the three different analytical methods into one requires converting the various measurements into one framework by using GIS.
	1. To correlate vector-based data with polygon-based data, the size of each grid must cover part of the street as well as a building adjacent to that street.
12. Whether this proposed spatial classification methodology could express various degrees of socio-economic performance of urban areas requires investigation of independent variables. Human behaviour records can be regarded as a good representation of an area’s socio-economic activities (Schaick and Spek, 2008). P105
13. Several indicators are used to assess these towns from a socio-economic perspective, including population density, population structure, amount of office space, percentage of the workforce in creative employment (for example, designers, architects, artists), availability of facilities, and immigration rates (Reijndorp, 2009). P 107
14. To what extent are these towns’ socioeconomic characteristics correlated with their built environments?
15. The higher the density of the built-mass, the higher the degree of multi-functionality within buildings.
	1. The results indicate that the lower a town’s socioeconomic ranking, the higher the number of areas with low spatial values, and vice versa.
16. The data from this inquiry indicate that a hierarchical relationship exists between streetnetwork integration, building density and land use. This accords with the long life of roads in comparison with buildings and the frequently changing functions within buildings (Nes, 2002).
	1. A classification system based on this hierarchical relationship can be used to identify the spatial elements with low values in unbalanced areas and to indicate where and what kinds of improvements are needed
17. An urban area’s genotype is revealed by the way the space syntax method shows the hidden spatial logic of the street structure.
	1. The spacematrix method shows how the relationship between [[FSI]] and [[GSI]] yields a classification of the density of the built mass.
	2. The MXI method shows degrees of land-use diversity.
18. This research contributes to exploration of the internal, spatial, evolving ‘logic’ of urban form, and ‘the rules of transformation over time…laws that urban morphology tries to identify’ (Levy, 1999, p. 79). P 115
19. The results of our research suggest that we may be assembling some constituents of a theory of the natural urban transformation process. Not only does the spatial structure of the street and road network influence building density and types, and degree of land-use diversity, but the degree of land-use diversity is also affected by building density and types.
