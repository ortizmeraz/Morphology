```ad-abstract
The principal aim of this paper is to present the capabilities of newly developed GIS tools for measurement analysis of urban spatial layouts, using the square grid method. The study of urban morphology and metrology is a multistage process, which involves the metrological analysis of town plans. The main research step is the determination of measurement modules of town layouts, using the square grid. By using GIS software, the authors developed a new tool, named HGIS Tools, which allow to create any number of modular grids with the selected cell size that corresponds to urban units of distance and surface area. When investigating a large number of towns and cities, this offers a significant improvement of the research procedure. The paper presents a test of the tool’s potential on the example of regular medieval towns from the area of the former Teutonic Order state (currently the territory of Poland), diversified in terms of size, genesis and morphometrics. The obtained results confirmed that HGIS Tools allowed to determine the hypothetical measurement module of the layout of the cities studied. The results were consistent with the analyses of other authors carried out with the traditional grid-square methods. The test of the HGIS Tools showed their significant potential in conducting morphometric analyses of spatial arrangements of urban spatial layout on a larger scale.

## Bullet points
1. The functionality of tools available in the ArcMap application from ESRI is insufficient to conduct morphological and morphogenetic research.
2. The common denominator of morphological and morphogenetic settlement research is the analysis of archival cartographic material [1,7–14]. However, we can be faced with numerous challenges when attempting to use archival maps and plans to obtain data concerning the spatial development of a given settlement unit in the past [15].
3. Metrological studies of modern base maps alone, not backed up by archaeological and architectural research, may lead to erroneous conclusions, due to the changing ownership divisions and development over the ages [20]. The process of ‘town-plan analysis’, which uses post-medieval cartography as a source from which to reconstruct medieval urban topographies, in contrast to the Conzenian school, is often criticized [15,21]. For these reasons, results based on cartographic sources have to be confronted with other data sources [2]. Analyses of non-cartographic sources conducted by historians and art historians are especially important here.
4. In urban morphogenetic and metrological research, the main aim is usually to find the roots of the form, to explain its genesis, and then to recreate its past development [24]. In morphological studies, the primary issue in the spatial research of urban layouts (measurement analysis) is the determination of modular rules for its measurement, and the discovery of the units of distance and area measurement used when plotting them in the field.
5. The next stage in the metrological analysis is the search for the modular structure of field parcels, plots in urban settlements, urban blocks, building sites and other elements [25].
	1. One of the methods used for metrological analyses of urban measurements is the square grid [25–31]…. The grid may be wellmatched or not. The grid has to be drawn over a copy of the town plan, using trial and error. To examine a larger group of towns, a whole set of grids of different gauges and scales could be drawn by hand.
	2. By using a modular grid for a town plan and conducting detailed metrological measurements, the shapes, size and proportions of markets, as well as plots and urban blocks can be analyzed.
	3. We can distinguish two types of grids: primary—actual measurements and a grid of essential elements of the urban layout—which facilitates the discovery of the composition idea behind the urban settlement, an analysis of the elements of layout of individual systems, such as the location of the market, the ratio between its size and the overall area of the city, as well as an analysis of the repeatability of market dimensions in other elements of the city. Additionally, it makes it easier to compare different planning concepts [25].
	4. Quick creation of multiple grids was also tested, as well as their application to any calibrated map in different configurations. The usefulness of these tools is proven by tests conducted on town plans that were already studied using traditional square grids.
	5. In conclusion, it should be noted that the use of traditional methods, as well as the new version of the tool proposed here to create square grids is just one of the elements that support the process of analyzing the layout, measurements and morphology of medieval or any other cities. As mentioned at the beginning of the paper, the methodology used in historical geography, based on analyses of archival town plans, should be confronted with historical sources and verified through archaeological research
