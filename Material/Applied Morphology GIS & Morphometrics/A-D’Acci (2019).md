```ad-abstract
This chapter introduces the isolated and joined meaning of the terms Urban, Morphology and Mathematics. After a brief synthesis of the re-emerging new science of cities and urban morphology, it speculates about cities conceived between hard and soft sciences under the complexity perspective.

Cities are ultimately the results of human behaviour, whose understanding might be reductive if solelyframedwithin a strictly‘mathematical’ confine.1 Human behaviour ‘is so complex and influenced by such a wide range of factors that any claim to provide precise, deterministic prediction is unrealistic’ (Inglehart 2018, p. 10). But there is another side of the coin: quantification andmathematicalmodelling are means enabling us to discover partially predictable macro paths of our behaviours otherwise unreadable. Even if ‘not deterministic […,] some trajectories are more probable than others’ (Inglehart 2018, p. 11): the mathematical language helps both in seeing these trajectories and in quantifying these probabilities.

2. The expression ‘mathematics of urban morphology’, has three terms: mathematics, urban and morphology; whose individual meanings are the following: ‘Morphology’ is built from the suffix ‘logy’, from ancient Greek λoγια ´ , mean ing ‘the study of’, and morphé meaning ‘form’, ‘shape’. It intrinsically involves a quantitative component, as it is defined ‘the scientific study of the structure and form of…’2; where ‘scientific’ evokes the scientific method introduced in the seventeenth century in the natural sciences ‘consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment […]’.3

4. ‘Urban’ is related to the Latin word urbs used to indicate the physicality of the city, as an ensemble of built structures.4 ‘Urban morphology’ is the study of urban form. It concerns the size, shape and physical structure of urban settlements. The American Planning Association sees urban morphology as the understanding of ‘the spatial structure and character of an urban area by examining its patterns and the process of its development’9; Kropf (2017, p. 9) as ‘concerned with the form and structure of cities, towns and villages, the way that they grow and change and their characteristics […]; and Batty as ‘patterns of urban structure based on the way activities are ordered with respect to their locations’10 stressing how the urban morphology, as [physical] patterns of urban structure, is linked with activities.

6. **A better understanding of urban forms helps the availability of measures, models and analysis, which in turn helps to make effective previsions (that eventually lead to decisions) on urban form issues, which is among the most urgent needs and with the longest lasting effects, in the sustainable development arena of a world whose current urbanization and population growth rates are unique in history.**

8. However, the mathematical approach to urban forms of contemporary times is not much oriented toward top-down planning of forms rather than the science of cities we intend today. The latter is more oriented towards the analytical (e.g. Geoffrey West’s research) finding for universal laws, and in the phenomenological (e.g. Michael Batty’s research) understanding of processes dealing with the emergence of various urban phenomena as forms, which are treated as a physical expression of our behaviours to be understood within the complexity science framework with the help of statistical physics, computation and formal models.

10. ... enormous availability of data, presents a great opportunity for the science of cities, or, to use the words of Marina Alberti, a challenge to ‘turn the unprecedented floods of data into new knowledge about urban systems and novel insights for their effective management’ (Alberti 2017 p. 2).
11. The modelling approach to cities, ‘emphasizes the development of robust theoretical constructs […] it seeks to fashion precise analytic representations of the world […] creating formalized, empirically testable, descriptions of the social world […] They may also be presented as mathematical formula […] closely related to […] physical sciences’ (Koch and Latham 2017, p. 9).
12. We can, however, briefly describe three main groups within the research community adopting mathematical models for spatial structures, which started fragmenting by the 1980s: one group oriented itself towards inferential statistics rather than formal theory and models; another towards mathematical models rather than empirical; another abandoned both statistical and mathematical theoretical modelling preferring postmodern approaches (White et al. 2015, p. 53).

14. This is the nature of science – an endless cycle of proud proposing and disdainful doubting’ (Mitchell 2011, p. 295). ‘Almost all theories of the city are largely qualitative, developed primarily from focused studies on specific cities or groups of cities supplemented by narratives, anecdotes, and intuition’ (West 2017, p. 269).
15. Using the words of Koonin and Holland (2014), the new opportunity is ‘to collect and analyze data that will allow us to characterize and quantify the ‘pulse of the city’. We are not alone in believing that a new science of cities is emerging’. Batty bases this new urban science on three principles: relations, scale and prediction;
16. Hillier believes in the enormous potential of scientific analysis of movement’s patterns, and recommends that urban designers have to internalize this knowledge and, according to complexity science, to use the self-organizational behaviour of cities. (Hillier 2004)

18. More recently, also West, claims the urgency to approach urban studies scientifically, quantitatively, when he firmly says: ‘we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities’ (West 2011).

20. D’Arcy Thompson describes the form of an object as ‘a “diagram of forces” in this sense, at least, that from it we can judge or deduce the forces that are acting or have acted upon it’; forms come from an ‘interaction or balance of forces’ (D’Arcy Thompson 1917, p. 11). Forces shaping cities and their forms come from economics reasoning of individuals, firms, companies and governments, behaviours and instincts of humans, cultural processes, historic paths, geographic-environmental influences/constrictions, technology, utopia, politics, alliances, markets, flows, trades and communications, physical and socio-economics networks, private/public interests, striving for well-being (objective and subjective, personal and collective), … all acting contemporarily at different physical and temporal scales; all the above is ‘us’, a multiscale, multitemporal summation of our behaviours and decisions, conscious or not, rational or not, instinctive or not.

22. Of a different opinion is the architectural historian Berkeleyan professor Spiro Kostof: ‘cities are too particular as phenomena – specific to moments in time and to the vicissitudes of site and culture – to be pinned down by absolute taxonomies’ (Kostof 2014a, p. 8). In search of a unifying law, almost three decades ago, also the distinguished mathematician Mitchell Feigenbaum asked (and replied to) himself: ‘Are there intrinsic geometries that describe various chaotic motions, that serve as a unifying way of viewing these disparate nonlinear problems, as kindred? ‘for more and more phenomena, their governing laws were wrung from Nature and their rules were recognized. Simultaneously, mathematics developed hand in hand with the natural sciences, and thus an understanding of the nature of a phenomenon soon came to also include the discovery of an appropriate mathematization of it’ (Bohr 1992, p. 11)

24. Hillier’s generic city, Bettencourt’s ‘statistical city’, and Kublai’s comprehensive city in the Calvino’s romance, tease our thoughts about the goal of a science of cities, that, according to Barthelemy, ‘will be reached when, considering a specific case, we can basically say what will happen and which ingredients it is necessary to introduce in a model in order to get more detailed information and predictions’ (Barthelemy 2016, p. 3). Sceptical about quantitative universal meanings, if without being accompanied from proper qualitative historical/cultural analysis, is again the historian architect Kostof: ‘city form is neutral until it is impressed with specific cultural intent. So there is no point in noticing the formal similarities […] unless we can elaborate on the nature of the content that was to be housed within each, and the social premises of the designers’, in fact we cannot be really able to read cities until we turn ‘to the archives, the history books, the old maps – until we assemble all the evidence, some of it often contradictory, that will help explain how a particular downtown got the look it now has’ (Kostof 2014b, pp. 10, 11).

26. There are signs for believing that these universal behaviours urban scientists are trying to uncover are linked with the self-organization property of complex systems as cities are. The Santa Fe school, from the Santa Fe Institute, focuses on the algorithmic logic behind complex systems; it is to some extent more related to abstract systems virtually explored by computer modelling, seeking to capture universal, general ways to explain how self-organization and adaptation of complex systems happen. It emphasizes the analytic-mathematical traditions of physics toward underlying laws.

28. Complexity and self-organizing systems theories’ application to urban studies is ‘an attempt to generalize and formalize the qualitative understandings developed within the framework of the humanities and social sciences’ (White et al. 2015, p. 14).

30. The same happens when we deal with urban systems and their physical forms which are the ultimate result of a complex sequence of interconnected multiscale multitemporal socio-economic forces constrained by local contexts, driven inside historical distinctive paths. History, not only mathematics, as Glaeser wisely starts one of his influential book, is essential for a complete urban study: ‘understanding cities requires more than current statistics.

32. In the 1950s the quantitative revolution criticized the scientific validity of the humanistic trend, which defined descriptive approaches. In turn, in the early 1970s scholars adopting urban social theories, through Structuralist Marxist and phenomenological idealistic perspectives, in the qualitative revolution, criticized the positivistic-quantitative approach.
33.  According to Portugali et al. (2012), the urban complexity science can be seen as a second scientific culture of cities or as a junction between the scientific and humanistic culture.
34. Also Batty, even if pushes the pendulum to the quantitative side, would like to think that is humanistic too in some sense, according to his way of thinking about science; in the urban context you also need intuition: quantifications without intuition may be a black box.32

36. Science sees the many in the one; art the one in the many. However, this new science based on the complexity paradigm,33 is a science that induces art, identified as personal uniqueness: each city emerges from unique contexts, from where the randomness of the micro-fluctuations, the unpredictability of the agent’s behaviours’ positive feedbacks and the contextual historic successions, generate although within universal macro patterns, unique scenarios; and each of them is personally read.
