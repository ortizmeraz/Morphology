```ad-abstract
This chapter introduces the isolated and joined meaning of the terms Urban, Morphology and Mathematics. After a brief synthesis of the re-emerging new science of cities and urban morphology, it speculates about cities conceived between hard and soft sciences under the complexity perspective.

Cities are ultimately the results of human behaviour, whose understanding might be reductive if solelyframedwithin a strictly‘mathematical’ confine.1 Human behaviour ‘is so complex and influenced by such a wide range of factors that any claim to provide precise, deterministic prediction is unrealistic’ (Inglehart 2018, p. 10). But there is another side of the coin: quantification andmathematicalmodelling are means enabling us to discover partially predictable macro paths of our behaviours otherwise unreadable. Even if ‘not deterministic […,] some trajectories are more probable than others’ (Inglehart 2018, p. 11): the mathematical language helps both in seeing these trajectories and in quantifying these probabilities.
