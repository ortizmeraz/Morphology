The modern discipline of urban morphology gives us a ground for the comparative analysis of cities, which increasingly includes specific quantitative elements. In this paper, we make a further step forward towards the definition of a general method for the classification of urban form. We draw from morphometrics and taxonomy in life sciences to propose such method, which we name ‘urban morphometrics’. We then test it on a unit of the urban landscape named ‘Sanctuary Area’ (SA), explored in 45 cities whose origins span four historic time periods: HISTORIC (medieval), INDUSTRIAL (19th century), NEW TOWNS (post-WWII, high-rise) and SPRAWL (post-WWII, low-rise). We describe each SA through 207 physical dimensions and then use these to discover features that discriminate them among the four temporal groups. Nine dimensions emerge as sufficient to correctly classify 90% of the urban settings by their historic origins. These nine attributes largely identify an area’s ‘visible identity’ as reflected by three characteristics: (1) block perimeterness, or the way buildings define the street-edge; (2) building coverage, or the way buildings cover the land and (3) regular plot coverage, or the extent to which blocks are made of plots that have main access from a street. Hierarchical cluster analysis utilising only the nine key variables nearly perfectly clusters each SA according to its historic origin; moreover, the resulting dendrogram shows, just after WWII, the first ‘bifurcation’ of urban history, with the emergence of the modern city as a new ‘species’ of urban form. With ‘urban morphometrics’ we hope to extend urban morphological research and contribute to understanding the way cities evolve.

2. Cities are crucial to human beings, society and the environment in the current urbanization age, the ‘metropolitan century’. The environmental, economic and social performance of cities will, in the next three to four decades, shape the future of the planet.
3. In this paper we look at one specific aspect of cities, their physical form.
4. A quantitative, comprehensive and systematic method to define, measure and classify urban form at this scale is necessary to explore, for example, why certain communities become safer, or develop higher levels of satisfaction or lower levels of car use and obesity, or thriving retail clusters.
5. However, despite its importance and practical urgency, a reliable science of urban form measurement and classification, or ‘urban morphometrics’, does not exist, nor consequently a true science of urban form evolution.

7. The most notable contributions come from complexity theories (including complex networks) and/or biology. A classical example is the fractal description of urban form where the intrinsic non-Euclidean geometry of human settlements is highlighted (Batty and Longley, 1994).
8. The role of established urban disciplines in such pioneering endeavour is nevertheless minimal; contributions from urban scholars are often part of fully interdisciplinary efforts the core of which sits well away from urban disciplines.

10. In this paper we introduce and test such framework by classifying the form of 45 urban areas.
11. To do so we: (a) identify the unit of analysis, at the appropriate scale; (b) define the constituent elements of urban form which are universally correspondent across all cases; (c) measure the visible (‘phenotypic’) manifestation of these elements in a way which is rigorous and replicable; (d) identify the smallest set of variables still capable to adequately cluster cases by similarity, where similarity is expressed only numerically and adequacy is measured against a clear validation theory; (e) derive a picture of such clustering that highlights what can arguably be defined as the first ‘bifurcation’ in urban history. The necessity to classify and organise the external world is the foundation of systematics, i.e. the ‘scientific study of the kinds and diversity of organisms and of any and all relationships among them’ (Simpson, 1961: 7).
12. The modus operandi of morphometrics is therefore ‘to quantify the size and shape of organisms with the methods of multivariate statistics’ (Klingenberg, 2002: 4).

14. In numerical taxonomy, Sneath and Sokal (1973) proceed by first identifying the Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU). OTU identification may entail taking into account multiple factors, such as classification purpose, structural organization of what is to be classified, its most appropriate rank and stage of development, or other not necessarily morphological factors.
15. When comparing two different OTUs, we actually compare the various states of their characters. Therefore, we must do so ‘over a set of characteristics applicable to both of them’ (Sneath and Sokal, 1973), or homologous characters.
16. For our morphometrics to support both a general classification of urban forms and a reliable validation process, a suitable OTU must be (1) unambiguous; (2) universally present in all cities; (3) large enough to represent a complete spectrum of all the constituent elements of urban form such that all their homologous characters can be rigorously defined and measured; (4) small enough to be morphologically specific (this excludes, for example, whole cities which exhibit enormous internal diversity); (5) functionally recognizable as units in the organizational structure of the city.
17. ... the ‘Sanctuary Area’ (SA) was identified as a recognizable part of the urban tissue (Mehaffy et al., 2010)
18. Therefore, we adopt the SA as our OTU: in this research,

20. To serve our purpose in this research, characters have to be (1) significant features of the form and evolution of the urban fabric, as acknowledged in relevant literature; (2) universally present in all SAs; (3) measurable remotely, without direct inspection in situ.
21. we identified nine basic elements of urban form (Table 2), i.e.: Urban Main (street), Local Main (street), Local (street), Building, Regular Plot, Internal Plot, Internal Way, Open Space and Natural Area. Such nine elements are constituent parts of three higher order components: the Street, the Block and the Natural Area. The overall structure they create is spatially hierarchical, in that the lower order elements are spatially entirely contained in, and exactly constitutional of, the higher order components; for example Blocks are exactly comprised of Regular Plots, Internal Plots, Open Spaces and Internal Ways.

23. To commence simply, we identify four highly distinguishable historic origin groups as described in literature: (a) HISTORIC (compact medieval town centres); (b) INDUSTRIAL (compact dense working class housing from the late 19th and early 20th century); (c) NEW TOWNS (post-war modernist ‘towers-in-the-park’ developments); (d) SPRAWL (post-war low density and low rise ‘lollipop’ suburbs).

25. The actual measurement of SAs is conducted manually after each of them was mapped in a Geographic Information System environment: all 2D characters such as Building coverage are identified spatially on the map, while 3D characters such as Building Height are added

27. Several multivariate statistical analyses, detailed in Supplemental material (SR), were undertaken to address all phases of data processing, including method validation (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)), variable ranking (Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)) and taxonomic assessment (Hierarchical Clustering Analysis).
28. **Validation and results**
29. To assess our method’s reliability in classifying cases according to the numerical expression of their form, we first undertake a PCA (Brereton, 2009; Hair et al., 2006). PCA allows a phenomenon originally described by multiple variables to be described by a reduced set of axis, maintaining an acceptable level of representativeness; for details see Supplemental material (SR).

31. We design a CBA to test the relative value of incrementally considering higher ranked variables in the model (Brereton, 2009).

35. In this light, the reason why cities changed so abruptly their spatial structure after WWII is not because urban planners and designers changed their attitude, but exactly because they did not, while everything around them was changing at exceptional speed and unprecedented scale. The steady attitude of urban planners and designers continued to produce spemes which, previously practicable only in few exceptional cases, found in the roaring times of post-war global urbanization an ideal environment to prosper and spread at amazing speed. In conclusion, the Anthropocene sets environmental conditions to urban evolution that make the production of cities an extremely dangerous game for life on planet Earth, the rules of which cannot be approached ideologically, symbolically or mystically any longer. We have never been more in need of planning and design than now, and never more than now we have been in need of innovation in the way we conceive urban planning and design.
