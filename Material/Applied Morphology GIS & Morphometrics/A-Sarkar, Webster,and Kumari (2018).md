```ad-abstract
Built environment factors, especially street-scale design and traffic casualties, are intrinsically interlinked. Starting from Alker Tripp's seminal ideas about city design, street morphology, and accident risk, this article summarizes results from an increasingly sophisticated line of enquiry at the boundaries between transport geography, network modeling, urban geography, and planning. It goes on to specify what we believe to be the most comprehensive study yet, based on five years' worth of road casualty data from London; GIS data on street morphology and physical features captured at a street-link unit of analysis; socio-economics and other determinants of accidents; and individual data about casualty victims. We test hypotheses about links between urban morphology and casualty severity using multi-level models with individual victim attributes at level-one, street-link morphology attributes (various measure of network connectivity) at level-two, and neighborhood descriptors at level-three.
Results indicate that street-level morphology and design (expressed in terms of betweenness, divergence ratio, and hull radius), together with traffic volume and physical features of streets are all significantly associated with odds of “Killed and Seriously Injured” (KSI) causality incidents. We find the strongest evidence yet recorded that London's 20-MPH speed-restricted residential zones reduce the incidence of KSI; while neighborhood-level factors such as population density, deprivation of living environment, and access to services are also significant predictors of KSI indicating that selective urban territorial enclosure can save lives.

2. Walking and cycling are the most vulnerable transport modes, interacting with traffic at high speed and mass, and considerable research and policy focus has been laid on minimizing crash frequencies and fatalities. The important role played by built environment factors, especially street-scale design in the incidence of traffic casualties has long been established.

4. (Perry, 1929). Perry’s neighborhoods were functionally defined and bounded on all sides by arterial roads with retail and commercial services located adjacent to the high volume roads, and had autonomous internal residential street layouts to facilitate pedestrian movement and discouraged traffic.
5. In one of the earliest empirical studies of scientific traffic planning, Marks (1957) reported a higher 5-year crash frequency of 77 crashes/year in the gridded street patterns of Los Angeles County compared to only 10.2 crashes/year on limited–access sub-divisions, with significantly higher crash frequencies on 4-way intersections than 3-way intersections. Stress was laid on the creation of residential areas with fewer and narrower streets for traffic exclusion, designed sidewalks and planting, landscaped circles and ovals at junctions for controlling traffic speeds, staggered cross streets, dead-end streets and culde-sacs for integrating multi-modal transport and pedestrian flows (Southworth & Ben-Joseph, 1995).

7. The study employed a multi-level modeling strategy and aimed to: a) examine associations between road casualty severity and underlying urban morphology and physical design at the level of individual road links after adjusting for neighborhood-level and casualty-level factors, b) assess these relationships for vehicle-occupant and pedestrian casualties, c) and identify the impact of spatial scales upon casualty severity.
8. In the US, Ewingand Dumbaugh (2009) found three factors of their metropolitan sprawl indices: higher density, finer land use mix, and more centering, to be associated with lower per capita highway crash fatality.
9. Dumbaugh and Rae (2009) reported higher traffic crashes and injuries along the arterial and arterial oriented commercial development and fewer crashes along traditional pedestrian-scaled developments in the City of San Antonio, Texas.
10. **Methods**
11. As per our primary hypothesis, we aim to examine the links between street morphology measured at multiple spatial scales and road casualty severity after adjusting for a range of other influencing factors.
12. From a public health perspective, there have been several studies linking street-level configuration and design with key public health phenomenon, notably walkability, obesity, and mental health (Ball et al., 2012; Frank et al., 2006; Sarkar et al., 2013a; Sarkar et al., 2014). More recently however, only a few studies have examined the relationships of objective measures of street level geometry and configuration with traffic accidents.
13. We hypothesize that street-level spatial layout and design configure the socio-spatial distribution of casualty risk severity.
14. We test our hypothesis by employing the large-scale Police STATS19 road casualty data of the Department of Transport for the Greater London Authority over a 5-year period.

16. Founded on classical network theory, sDNA theorizes that it is the topology and geometry of the network that governs the extent of kinetic resistance to flows through them. Network topology and geometry determine the friction governing distribution of the agglomeration benefits and dis-benefits that characterize a city.
17. **Street-link physical attributes**
18. Predictors of street link-level physical features were derived from STATS19 database and comprised road type, junction type, and type of pedestrian crossing facilities.
19. The type of pedestrian crossing facilities in a street link with casualty incidence was expressed in terms of: not having any crossing facility within 50 m, pedestrian phase at traffic signal junction, zebra, and others.
20. Network centrality was assessed through betweenness, which measures the through-movement flow of a street link in the urban network. It is proportional to the simulated count of movements passing through the link from and to all other parts of the network, assuming that journeys in the network follow the shortest angular path between all pairs of segments.
21. Centrality is an important aspect of urban spatial economics as well as urban design.
22. It defines the degree of connectedness or accessibility within an urban network in terms of distance (both Euclidean and geometric) as well as time costs and hence, configures all the related geographical and socio-economic phenomena.
23. Network analysis techniques are driven by simple and tested, yet computationally demanding, mathematical algorithms that owe their origins to graph theory (Crucitti et al., 2006; Freeman, 1979; Hillier, 1999; Porta et al., 2006; Wasserman & Faust, 1994).
24. In the present study, we employ spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA), a multi-level network modeling technique for objective assessment of street-level form and morphology.1
25. The mean diversion ratio (MDR) is a measure of network efficiency and calculates the degree of deviation from the most

29. High betweenness at walking scale indicates a street structure conducive to relatively high volumes of pedestrian flow through the street link. City scale betweenness indicates a street structure conducive to relatively high volumes of vehicle movement.

33. Previous studies have also found a positive association between street section length and casualty counts (Abdel-Aty & Radwan, 2000; Anastasopoulos & Mannering, 2009). Betweenness was consistently associated with higher odds of accident severity in the models involving all-casualty as well as vehicle user and pedestrian casualties.
34. Among the variables of street-link level physical attributes, dual carriageways, junctions as well as the existence of pedestrian crossing facilities were all associated with lower odds of casualty severity/fatality.
35. Betweenness is a network measure of centrality that can be taken as a proxy for through-movement flowing through a link. The higher the betweenness index of a street link, the greater the path overlap of journeys through it and hence more through movement.
36. The study reported a significant preventive effect of traffic control intervention in the form of 20-MPH zones reporting 35–36%, 33–35%, and 48–49% lower odds of being KSI within the zones for all-casualties, vehicular occupant, and pedestrian casualties, respectively.
37. A higher maximum convex hull radius at a local residential scale of 400 m was associated with higher odds of KSI incidents. Among the traffic volume variables, the density of heavy vehicles (coaches and LGVs) was consistently associated with higher odds of severe or fatal casualty owing to momentum effects and the corresponding risks of collision at significantly higher mass and speed.
38. Among the neighborhood level variables, the protective association between population density and casualty KSI was observed only in our all-casualties and vehicle-occupant casualty models.
39. These results demonstrate the significance of topological information contained within a graph-model of a street network, as well as exemplifying the role of geographical scale in understanding patterns of accident causality severity. Higher densities may also act as a proxy for more efficient street layouts installed to cope with a higher land use mix and concentrated development in a mature and well formed city like London.

41. The evidence presented in the study has demonstrated that detailed and objective measures of urban morphology and design were associated with street accident severity subsequent to adjustments for other related predictors including physical features of streets, traffic volume, and neighborhood-level deprivation.
42. Our study has the potential to contribute towards the creation of safe and sustainable transport systems. Evidences of the relationships between underlying street form and casualty severity can be employed by transport planners in developing preventive interventions in the form of alternate traffic flow and circulation models to reduce risks in hotspot zones.
