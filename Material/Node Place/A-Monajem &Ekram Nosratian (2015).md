Urban planners usually consider the [[public transit | transportation system ]] and [[land use|land use systems]] in different ways. The [[node place]] model is an analytical tool that explores the interaction between the transportation and land use systems in station areas in an urban region. The essential issue with the node place model is spatial. To address this issue, spatial indices are added to the model. Another purpose of this paper is to provide a procedure to identify the most effective transportation and land use dynamics in station areas. In this respect, canonical correlation analysis was conducted on data concerning Tehran’s subway stations. The resulting spatial indices have a fairly logical relationship with other transportation and land use indices, and it is useful to incorporate these indices in the node place model. The case studies demonstrated that a well-integrated, continuous and dense spatial configuration of the street network in station areas is associated with an increase in the variety and intensity of activities, an increase in the workforce and better accessibility for the station by attracting greater pedestrian movement. Additionally, these case studies indicated that to sustain a station area, the streets that exist in a station area and the streets that are connected to a station should be connected to the streets that locally benefit from well-integrated areas within fewer steps.

Another purpose of this paper is to provide a procedure to identify the most effective transportation and land use dynamics in station areas. In this respect, canonical correlation analysis was conducted on data concerning Tehran’s subway stations. The resulting spatial indices have a fairly logical relationship with other transportation and land use indices, and it is useful to incorporate these indices in the node place model.

Additionally, these case studies indicated that to sustain a station area, the streets that exist in a station area and the streets that are connected to a station should be connected to the streets that locally benefit from well-integrated areas within fewer steps.

The node place model, proposed by Bertolini (1999), is an analytical tool that explores the interaction between transportation system and land use system in station areas in an urban region. Although the node place model cannot indicate future paths of development, it is beneficial for better understanding of development dynamics (Chorus and Bertolini, 2011).

In this research, in addition to the main model, the node place values of a station were also studied from another point of view. To evaluate the influence of the local streets around a station, the role of spatial configuration was considered in the developed model. It is believed that the quality of street connections affects the station attraction for pedestrian movement (node values) and the variety and density of land use (place values).

The attractiveness of an urban space depends on its vitality (Hillier, 2007). The spatial configuration of the street network also determines the movement patterns between various places and partially determines the degree of functional mix that impacts urban livability (Hillier, 2007). Through-movement potential describes the accessibility of an area on various scales.

**The node place model**

In the present research, to evaluate the situation of the Tehran station areas, the node place model is applied. The main model embodies two sets of indices proposed by Bertolini (1999), Reusser et al. (2008) and enhanced them. In this research, the node-place indices were computed according to the accessible data (Table 1). The data of workforce and population was obtained from the Tehran Urban Planning and Research Center, and the data of the subway station distances and the train frequencies were obtained from the Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway Operation Co.

**Development of the model**
Two spatial indices determine the extent of the node place model (Bertolini, 1999; Reusser et al., 2008). To-movement and through-movement are computed using the following formulas. To-movement or Closeness, as defined by Sabidussi (1966):

Through-movement or Betweenness, as defined by Freeman (1977):

In the next step, the spatial indices($Y_{(5)}$,$Y_{(6)}$,$Y_{(7)}$,$Y_{(8)}$ ) are added to the model. In this way, the main model is improved, as described in Table 2.

To incorporate the four spatial indices in the developed model, four separate analyses were performed using Depthmap 10 software. The steps are as follows:

1. Prepare an axial map based on the Tehran block map.

2. Prepare a fewest-line map based on the axial map.

3. Convert the axial map to a segment map to analyze the angular choice.

           

**The quantities of the node indices**

4. Perform local integrated analysis (R3):

Determine the axis quantities that are connected to the station.

5. Perform angular choice analysis for a low metric radius (700 m):

Determine the street segment quantities that are connected to the station.

**The quantity place indices**

6. Cut the station area (radius of 800 m4) from the fewest-line map and the segment map.

7. Perform global integration analysis (Rn):

Determine the axial quantities that exist in the station area.

8. Perform angular choice analysis with a global radius:

Determine the street segment quantities that exist in the station area.

**A stressed station area: Darvaze Shemiran Station**

Darvaze Shemiran Station is an intersecting station, joining two lines of the subway. The station is located in a historical area and in the center of Tehran, zone 12 (CBD). According to the data collected (Table 7), the population and workforce are strongly significant, as is the degree of functional mix. As presented in Table 4, the closer to the CBD, the larger number of workers and the greater variety and density of activities in the station area are. According to Fig. 5, the street network around the station is quite dense, so there is a greater chance for this area to be livable. Moreover, the streets are locally well integrated and continuous, providing better accessibility. According to angular choice analysis (through-movement), pedestrians are more likely to walk through Pol Choobi, Roshandelan and Gorgan Streets to reach Darvaze Shemrian Station. The streets that exist in this area are connected to Enqelab Street (along with Azadi Street), being only a few steps away. Enqelab Street has the most local integration among the streets of the Tehran network, which causes the streets connected to it to be well-integrated.

**A dependent station area: Kolah Dooz Station**
Kolah Dooz Station is a terminus located within a distance of 10 km from the CBD (zone 13). This station is next to the Shahid Doran Highway. In the south and east of the station, a vast open space exists (Fig. 6). From Table 7, the population and workforce around the station are found to be relatively small; moreover, the land use variety and density are negligible. The spatial configuration of the street network in this station area is segregated, and no good street is connected to the station to attract pedestrian movement. Despite the organized and continuous street network (Fig. 6), the existence of wide-open space in the area and the poor density of the streets lead to low place-spatial and node-spatial indices. Along with these weaknesses, this station suffers from a lack of connection to well-integrated streets within a few steps.
