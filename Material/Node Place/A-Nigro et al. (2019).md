```ad-abstract
It is widely accepted that land use and public transport planning should be harmonised in order to provide a viable alternative to car transport. Following the **Transit-Oriented Development** (TOD) concept, many studies and plans aim to concentrate urban development in areas accessible by high-quality **public transport**. Encouraged by studies asserting the positive relation between urban density and public transport use, scholars and practitioners focused their attention on tools and strategies that increase urban density, thereby overlooking geographical contexts where these strategies cannot be applied. TOD might however be also a valuable strategy in low-density contexts, like lower density parts of metropolitan areas, or suburban areas and small towns. It seems therefore relevant and interesting to develop a methodology to explore the value of TOD strategies in such contexts. Our paper fills this analytical and application gap and proposes to extend the conceptualization and implementation of land use and public transport integration to areas where low-density urban development has already occurred (e.g., low-density suburbs, or areas where the protection of natural and cultural heritage precedes urban development). In such cases, where is not possible to increase urban density around transport nodes, the quality of the transport network plays a decisive role. The approach builds on the Node-Place Model by including evaluations of the quality of feeder networks. We applied the methodology to a case study in the Campania Region in southern Italy, indicating a possible way to evaluate land use and public transport integration while considering, at the same time, the quality of transport as network. The application of the methodology allowed to highlight imbalances between accessibility – by main and feeder transport – and land use intensity, and to sketch urban development strategies and priorities of intervention on the transport network.

The indicators belong to three families (see Appendix A for the complete list):

- [[Node indicators]];

- [[Place indicators]] (differentiated by catchment areas);

- [[Feeder transport indicators]] (differentiated by transport modes)

- The combination of these indicators yields a ‘three-component’ node-place analysis, where the ‘**place’ dimension is determined by land use intensity and diversity** – described with place indicators – and by quality of feeder transport – described with feeder transport indicators (determining the size of the area). ** The ‘node’ dimension is determined by node indicators only.**

 - Node indicators, by means of averaging, are translated into a [[node index|Node Index]], while the procedure used to obtain a Place Index is more complex. In this case, in fact, land use and feeder transport indicators are first transformed – separately – into average values.

- Next, these values are multiplied in pairs according to the transport mode considered, in order to obtain Place Indexes referred to each catchment area.

 - As the final step, the average of Place Indexes allows for the calculation of a ‘General’ Place Index.

- Considering the large volume of information involved, our methodology relies on a ‘three-stage’ node-place analysis, in which each step gives different insights, summarised as follows:
	1. a ‘general’ node-place analysis;
	2.  a ‘detailed’ node-place analysis, differentiated by transport mode;
	3.  a ‘radar chart’ analysis, able to display which catchment area could host more urban development, and whether an improvement of the main or feeder transport might be needed.

The second stage corresponds to a fourfold node-place analysis detailed by feeder transport and the relative catchment areas. In this case, the horizontal axes of the diagrams display Place Indexes (Pw*Tw, Pb*Tb, Pp*Tp, Pc*Tc), while vertical axes display Node Index (N) values – see Fig. 7.

The third stage of the study is represented by the radar diagrams reported in Fig. 9.

**4.2.1. Node indicators**

Node indicators describe main transport quality by considering the number of directions served, frequency and presence of ticketing service. They are:

- Directions;
- Frequency (workdays);
- Frequency (holydays);
- Ticketing.

**4.2.2. Place indicators**

Regarding Place indicators, we considered, beyond the usual indicators referring to residential and job density, also one indicator referred to places of education.

The number of students for each education facility is associated with the point feature representing the location of the education facility itself. If the point is included within a certain catchment area, the related number of students is associated with said catchment area. Place indicators are:

- Estimated residential density;
- Estimated job density;
- Number of students.

**4.2.3. Feeder transport indicators**

In the case of walk and bike transport we based all indicators on qualitative analyses. In particular, we selected four elements seen as having a decisive impact on the bike modal choice: presence and quality of bike lanes, traffic intensity (Buehler and Pucher, 2012; Xing et al., 2010), average size of the roads that give access to stations, average slope of the roads within the cycling area (Dill and Voros, 2007).

Feeder transport indicators are:
- Walking;
- Bike lanes;
- Expected traffic intensity;
- Road size;
- Road slope;
- Feeder transport;
- Feeder lines;
- Bus stop accessibility;
- Frequency (workdays);
- Frequency (holydays);
- Fare integration;
- Passenger facilities;
- Car parking;
- Car parking accessibility.
