```ad-abstract
Centralisation of activities and developments around metro station areas is a key transit-oriented development (TOD) policy to encourage more public transport travel through providing maximum access to passengers, thereby enhancing economic efficiency, health, well-being and social inclusion. The node-place-design model is an analytical approach, which investigates the interaction between land use, transportation and the walking friendliness around station areas. Nevertheless, current research focuses on the role station areas plays at the local scale, and little consideration is given to the strategic network (system) level. In this research, we combine a strategic network indicator (criticality) with the node-place-design model to gain deeper insights into London metro station areas in terms of their transit-oriented-development at both local and system levels. Our research has three principal findings: first, most of station areas in Greater London show balanced situations between transport and land use development, except for some stations with a non-walking friendly environment such as Victoria station. Second, the two-tier approach finds that the system criticality of each station area can vary substantially even within the same cluster grouped by the original node-place-design model. Therefore, identifying station groups with relatively high network criticality and relatively low node-place-design score is of potential value. The promising transport connection and less-developed conditions of those station areas could help policymakers locate an intensification-diversification TOD group. Conversely, locations with high nodeplace-design values but low criticality could point to stations suitable for network expansion (new lines or interchanges). Third, the result reconfirms the value of introducing the third dimension – design – into the TOD evaluation of stations at the local scale. The relatively low correlation between node and design value is consistent with previous findings that a transport service-intensive and functionally diverse metro station area does not necessarily produce an accessible friendly walking environment. Overall, the paper provides a platform for further studies integrating strategic network and node-place-design attributes.

2. The major debate concerning TOD is interpreting the common characteristics of its built environment, such as mixed use, density, design, collaboration between land and transport, and proximity (Ewing and Cervero, 2001; Cervero and Kockelman, 1997; Sung and Oh, 2011; Nasri and Zhang, 2014; Nasri and Zhang, 2012). Gradually different metrics like socio-economic and transit services (Lund et al., 2004) have been built into the understanding of the relations between TOD common elements and vehicle miles travelled (VMT) (Nasri and Zhang, 2014) or transit ridership (Cervero, 2007; Cervero and Dai, 2014).
3. The earliest evaluation of station area TOD can be traced back to the node-place model introduced by Bertolini (1996), which is essentially an analytical framework for assessing station areas in both transport and land use aspects.
4. The ‘node’ variable draws attention to the function of the station as a transport node, and measures the diversity and intensity of its transport function, which translates into the potential to promote physical and economic interaction.
5. Vale (2015), who suggested adding the third dimension ‘design’ to assess pedestrian accessibility around stations. That is to say, to examine if station areas achieve an effective integration of transport and land use, current studies mainly focus on three dimensions: 1) multimodal accessibility of the station; 2) land use diversity and intensity, and 3)pedestrian-oriented design (Vale et al., 2018).
6. The ‘place’ variable considers the station as a site where people gather for extra transport functions, and measures the diversity and intensity of activities found in a station.
7. The balance between these two variables provides an indicator of the integration level of transport and other functions of a station.
8. Despite the benefits of the node-place-design model, current studies mainly focus on stations areas at the local level without a fuller consideration of the system level. Yet the TOD concept no longer remains at station catchment area at local scale, but extends to a broader geographical level.
9. Furthermore, Huanget al. (2018) argue that a transit node may have low performance at its individual level but serve an important role within the overall network.
10. Recent research on the node-place approach has provided greater sophistication in mainly three aspects, which are study area delineation, analytical index selection (Vale et al., 2018) and indicator enhancement. The first discussion is about the specification of TOD boundaries in practical analysis. Generally, an 800-m buffer (0.5 mile) is used for rail stations (Bernick and Cervero, 1997); a 400-m buffer (0.25 mile) is used for bus stops (Zhao et al., 2003).
11. Accordingly, the major aim of this paper is to extend the existing node-place-design approach by including a strategic network dimension and apply this to metro station areas' classification in Greater London.

13. The second discussion pertains to extending the node-place model by adding a third dimension, design (Vale et al., 2018, Lyu et al., 2016).
14. Vale (2015) firstly came up with the point that TOD classification of stations should be based on three different aspects: land use, transportation and walkability conditions. He suggested adding the human oriented indicators like pedshed ratio to reflect the accessibility (walking condition) of station areas.
15. Grounded in the functional understanding of the urban spatial structure, the network-based approach delineates the spatial interactions among communities through extracting the characteristics of the urban socio-economic associations networks (Chowell et al., 2003; McMillen, 2001), which sheds lights on deciphering the organisations and hierarchical relations between sub-regions.
16. A number of empirical studies have found that functional network centrality can effectively capture location advantage in a city and reflect intra-urban variation of land use and transport intensity and hierarchy (Roth et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014). Therefore, we introduce a strategic network (criticality) component to enhance the value of the node-place design approach.
17. The third aspect is about indicators enhancement. Originally, Bertolini (1999) came up with fifteen indicators (nine for node, six for place) to assess a station area's node and place functionalities.
18. Recent research put more focus on the discussion of walkability-related measures, such as pedshed ratio (Vale, 2015), cul-de-sac density (Kamruzaman et al., 2014), connectivity (Van Nes and Stolk, 2012), intersection density, accessible network length (Vale et al., 2018; Lyu et al., 2016), and average block size (Lyu et al., 2016). A detailed discussion of indicators can be found in Lyu et al. (2016).
19. As mentioned above, the recent discussion is mainly at local level around each station area per se. However, there is no consistent basis for understanding multiple roles of station areas, particularly the role stations play in urban polycentricity at regional level, whereas it has been found that providing land use and transport services requires long term planning at both regional and local level (Kamruzaman et al.,2014).
20. In line with Vale et al. (2018), our method is based on fourteen indicators (Table 1): seven for the node index, four for the place index, and three to measure the design of the metro station areas. All variables are collected from the catchment areas with 960 m radius and checked for normality.
21. In other words, TOD not only offers the potential to create attractive station areas but also to shape polycentric cities and regions, mitigate urban sprawl and boost public transport ridership (Calthorpe and Fulton, 2001; Geurs et al., 2012; Leu et al.,2010).
22. The statistical literature (Douglass et al., 2003; Belsley, 1991) provides several quantifications of collinearity, with the most recurring being the correlation coefficient (r).
23. However, very few studies have in cluded a regional TOD concept into transit classification. One exception is Papa et al. (2013), who identified seven typologies of stations areas drawing on network closeness and accessibility in the Randstad area.

25. If there is collinearity between indicators, principal component analysis (PCA) will be conducted to reduce collinearity among variables.
26. Not only can this approach indicate the contribution of each indicator, but it also reduces the collinearity among indicators.

28. One point to note here is that some studies (e.g. Caset et al., 2018) included centrality indicators such as betweenness and closeness into the nodal aspect, but those network indicators are calculated based on the features of transit infrastructure network instead of the passengers' movement network.
29. We use a weighted betweenness centrality as an index to identify the relative positioning of local areas in the more global spatial structure and measure how well-connected an area is (Zhong et al., 2014).
30. As found in Iyer et al.'s (2013) work, the betweenness centrality can better identify the most critical stations compared to other centrality algorithms. The index is defined as the number of shortest paths passing through a vertex, where consider paths between all connected vertex pairs (Newman, 2010; Barabási, 2016).

32. Second, boundaries selection (e.g., the shape and catchment radius of station areas) can to some extent affect the results, especially when defining the different catchment radii for the stations within Inner London and Outer London. Future research therefore could focus on doing comparative study to examine to what extent the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP) of catchment selection may affect station areas classification.
33. This paper gives an example of the potential contribution of network analysis in assessing how well station areas are aligned with the goal of transit-oriented development.
34. This study has three key findings. First, the analysis shows that station areas in Greater London generally have good integration of transport, land use and walking environment.
35. Finally, we suggest that the extended model could be further developed to include (i) an additional indicator to capture the relative local centrality of a station's position in its local street network (as a measure of local network orientation to the station, to complement design indicators); and (ii) additional strategic network indicators (e.g. more centrality indicators should be included to examine their effectiveness on reflecting criticality at the system scale).
36. Second, this study finds that there are significant discrepancies of criticality of station areas within the same cluster....
37. Third, while the correlation analysis reveals that there are positive associations between any pair of node, place and design indices, the relatively low correlation between node and design values in this study corroborates previous findings of Vale et al. (2018) that a high-performance node does not necessarily have a walking friendly station area.
38. The two-tier approach could help them identify potential TOD stations which are worth considering for intervention. Stations with relatively high system criticality and relatively low node-place-design value (such as Wembley Park) could be worthy of attention as potential candidates for encouraging densification and diversification to increase the land use efficiency and thereby accommodate the urban growth.
39. The framework could also assist with future metro or rail system planning, for example, in directing attention to where new lines, stations or interchanges could be considered, echoing the example of Angel, which has a high node-place-design value but low network criticality.
40. We recognise some limitations in our results, and areas for further development. First, we give little consideration of the context-specific node, place and design indicators.
