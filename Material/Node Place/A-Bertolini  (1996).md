```ad-abstract
An interpretation of the redevelopment prospects of railway stations and their surroundings is proposed. Station locations are at the same time nodes and places, affected by both global and local dynamics. Their potential roles within increased transport integration and emerging multi-centered urban regions provide the foundations for their transformation. However, the task is a complex one, as a discussion of the issues connected with the intensification of flows, the accumulation of activities, and the tangle of actors which characterize these projects shows. More attention must be paid to the integration of the node and place dimensions and of diverging redevelopment strategies.

## Bullet points
1. The application to station areas of conceptual frameworks such as those proposed by Castells (1989) and Dematteis (1988) is intriguing. Central to these analyses is the tension between a space of global connections (the 'space of flows' in Castells; the 'geography of networks' in Dematteis) and a space of local disconnections (the 'space of places' in Castells; 'the geography of areas' in Dematteis). In and around railway stations this tension, almost literally, materializes.
2. On one hand, stations offer a (potential) connection to several of the material and immaterial flows that create value in the current 'informational' (Castells, 1989) mode of development. Stations are (or may become) important nodes in both transport and non-transport (e.g. business, consumption) networks.
3. The mixture of housing, small business premises and informal public spaces of the station's neighborhood are an expression of this local dimension. Between node and place spirals of both growth and decline may develop. Contrasts are well depicted by the heterogeneity of the area's populations.
4. In contemporary metropolises of the industrialized world activities are subject to both decentralization and reconcentration processes. Next to ongoing suburbanization, selective reurbanization is also being observed. An inspiring way to account for both of the phenomena are 'networks and nodes' representations of metropolitan space.
5. Whatever its potentials, railway station redevelopment has to overcome many obstacles. Experience abounds with examples of unsuccessful ventures. The complexity of railway station redevelopment has many intertwined aspects. I will focus on three basic and often neglected ones. I will call them the 'intensification of flows', the 'accumulation of activities' and the 'tangle of actors'.
6. **The Intensification of Flows** The transformation of railway stations into modern transportation and activity nodes is an extraordinary engineering challenge. Tri-dimensional, multi-level intersections catering to disparate transportation means (anything from high-speed lines to pedestrian routes) and other technical systems (often including advanced telecommunications) are becoming common. Infrastructural complications are the source of thorny dilemmas and translate into typically high, and sometimes completely prohibitive, transformation costs. In both practice and the literature there is awareness of the technical dimension of the problem. However, less attention has been directed towards another, but equally relevant, aspect: the intensification of flows means also a broader and more diverse range of players involved in the development and management of the complex.
7. **The Accumulation of Activities** The kind of built environment evoked by current railway station redevelopment projects is quite different from what is usually associated with these spaces. Sometimes the station itself disappears underneath towers of offices and giant shopping complexes. Station developers often contend that they want to create a fully fledged 'piece of city'. While it is not always clear what they mean by this, it is true that around railway stations increasingly varied assemblages of functions are coalescing. As with airports, the transportation node is becoming the magnet for more than just transport-linked activities: offices and shops dominate, while sport and recreational facilities, exhibition and convention centers, hotels, government buildings and (to a lesser degree) housing and light industry may be also present.
8. **The Tangle of Actors** The redevelopment of railway station areas engages a wide range of actors. The local government and/or the national railway company have characteristically the leading role, but also important are the central and intermediate levels of government, other transportation companies, developers and investors. Public-private partnerships are often formed to bring together those having a direct stake in the project. Usually excluded from the partnerships, but nevertheless heavily affected by redevelopment, are users (both travellers and nontravellers) and local interests. Among this last group the area residents and small businesses stand out as the most active. Each of these actors has its own objectives and a different kind of transformation in mind: and each of them controls resources that, in one way or another, are vital to the implementation of the project Seen from this angle, railway station redevelopment looks like an almost impossible mediation exercise.
