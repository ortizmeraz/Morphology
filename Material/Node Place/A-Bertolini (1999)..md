2. The continuing decentralization of cities is a widely documented phenomenon.
3. the environmental and social sustainability of this pattern of urban development remain unresolved issues, as decentralisation is typically associated with high rates of consumption of non-renewable resources, high levels of spatial segregation and other social costs (an overview of these findings is in Ewing, 1997).
4. A promising approach is public transport-oriented development at the scale of the urban region, as for instance suggested by Breheny & Rookwood(1993), Calthorpe (1993), Owens (1992) and more recently by Hall & Ward (1998).
5. While all these and other similar ones are important efforts, analytical tools to help identify the potential for public transport-oriented urban-regional development are as yet scarce.
6. do public transportation nodes as such have a specific urban (re)development potential? And what makes the task of (re)developing one node different from that of another?

8. Public Transportation Nodes and the Contemporary City
9. Probably the most important lesson of the ongoing debate around whether in the contemporary city spatial decentralisation or concentration trends prevail is that they both are at work.
10. The present dynamics of transportation nodes is a direct product of both these spatial decentralisation and spatial concentration forces.
11. Public transportation nodes and the surrounding areas appear thus one of the very few places in the contemporary city where the participants in its increasingly heterogeneous communities still physically meet (Bertolini, 1996).
12. Page 4
13. There appears to be, however, an important prerequisite: that the transportation node not be considered separately from its urban surroundings or the place of activities. On this principle is based the node-place model that will be discussed next.
14. A Node-Place Model
15. the enhancement and exploitation of the accessibility of the area can provide a unifying principle, on the condition that the term is not interpreted in too narrow a way.
16. accessibility is not just a feature of a transportation node (`how many destinations, within which time and with which ease can be reached from an area?’ ), but also of a place of activities (`how many, and how diverse are the activities that can be performed in an area?’ ). A third important component of accessibility is the user, or the question `by whom?’ (for theoretical underpinning of this notion of accessibility see Hansen, 1959; Breheny, 1978).
17. As node and place a public transportation node and its surroundings are part of a system of both competing and complementary nodes and places. In general these are all the alternative locations within a region. More specifically they are all the transportation nodes belonging to a particular transportation network.
18. At the Faculty of Geographical Sciences of the Universiteit Utrecht, we have developed a model to chart these differences. The model has been initially conveyed in a simple xy diagram (Figure 1).
19. the y value corresponds to the node-content of an area,
20. The x value corresponds to the place-content of an area
21. Four ideal±typical situations can be distinguished. Along the middle diagonal line are areas where the node and the place are equally strong. At the top of the line are areas `under stress’ .
22. Page 5
23. At the bottom of the middle line is a second ideal-typical situation, represented by the `dependent’ areas.
24. Finally, two `unbalanced’ situations can be identified. On one sided at the top left of the diagram these are the `unsustained nodes’ , areas where transportation facilities are relatively much more developed than urban activities.
25. The place-index is a measure of the intensity and diversity of activities in the area. For this purpose, the area has been defined as the surface included within a `walkable radius’ of 700 metres from the main pedestrian entrance to the public transportation node.

27. From a Static to a Dynamic Picture in order to assess (re)development opportunities and threats, such a static picture is not suficient.
28. provided, and in the measure that demand and supply mechanisms are free to operate, the demand for transportation services from the activity place and the demand for activities from the transportation node will find a (temporary) balance.
29. Page 9
30. In the agglomerations under examination an example of the first case would be the localisation of more and/or more diversified urban activities (living, working and/or other facilities)
31. From Compact Cities to Accessible Urban Regions
32. The contrasting movements across the diagram sketched above do not only have implications for each station area separately, but also for entire systems of areas,
33. The situation in an urban region at a given moment can be described in terms of clustering of locations: on the top, at the bottom or elsewhere along the middle line of the node-place diagram.

35. On a more general level, the application of the node-place model to the Amsterdam and Utrecht agglomerations shows the limits of a `traditional’

37. compact city policy as currently pursued in the Netherlands and being implemented or considered in other countries.
38. Yet, these developments appear often at odds with a public transport-oriented urban development. This is no minor drawback. Private motorised transport is the biggest consumer of energy and the main source of pollution in the contemporary city.
39. On the other hand, high physical mobility is a structural feature of our open urban systems. The solution of this sustainability dilemma lies in a spatial development pattern where more environmentally and socially friendly transportation modes, such as public transport, can increase their share.
40. Conclusions: `Deconcentrated Clustering’?
41. The node-place model introduced in this article offers a conceptual framework for the exploration of the (re)development potential of station areas in an urban region and thus improves the chances for public transport-oriented development.
42. The node-place model helps identify opportunities for intensification and/or differentiation of urban activities around (strengthened) public transportation nodes.

44. The city is an increasingly open system. Increasingly people live, work and spend their free time independently of municipal borders. The same applies to the activity patterns of ® rms and other organizations. A traditional compact city policy is possibly still sensible in situations where this structural openness of the urban system is limited.
45. It might seem just playing with words, but there is a fundamental difference in the focus: in the past at stake was a particular way of deconcentrating, today urban deconcentration is a fact, the point is how to cluster!
