4. In order to better understand social processes in urban space we will here start to discuss the critical role of spatial configuration and co-presence and the correspondence between these two aspects. research in architecture within the field of space syntax points out that the design of many housing estates prone to poverty and exclusion poses an obstacle to integration processes in itself (Hanson and Hillier 1987; Hanson 2000; Vaughan 2005; Legeby 2010, 2013).
5. According to Hillier and Hanson (1984), the spatial configuration of buildings and cities has a very direct influence on social life:By giving shape and form to our material world, architecture structures the system of space in which we live and move. In that it does so, it has a direct relation – rather than a merely symbolic one – to social life, since it provides the material preconditions for the patterns of movement, encounter and avoidance which are the material realisation – as well as sometimes the generator – of social relations. In this sense, architecture pervades our everyday experience far more than a preoccupation with its visual properties would suggest. (Hillier and Hanson 1984: ix)
6. Co-presence as well as random encounters and awareness of others are here seen as fundamental for many social processes, but even if space has an inherent social logic of this kind it is stressed that this does not mean that there is something like a ‘spatial determinism’ in a ‘cause and effect’ sense (Hillier 2013: 75).

8. ... research has shown that urban safety is maintained by the copresence of locals and strangers on the street, the interface between local residents and passers-by on the doorstep and the informal surveillance of residents over street space from the privacy of their front window (Hanson and Zako 2007: 20).
9. However, the degree to which such an inter face among residents and between residents and passers-by will develop is dependent on the emergence and distribution of movement flows, which in turn depend to a large degree on the configurational properties of space, that is, the degree to which a specific place – a street or a square – is related to other places even at great distances away (Hanson and Zako 2007: 15; Hillier 1996: 171).

11. Vaughan’s extensive studies of morphological influences on poverty, deprivation and social exclusion find that spatial form can itself be considered a factor in the geography of poverty (Vaughan 2005: 409). There is a relationship between physical segregation and social marginalisation and some urban areas are especially prone to settlement by impoverished immigrants.
12. By studying the relationship between spatial segregation and socio-economic segregation, Vaughan concludes that immigrant quarters have spatial attributes that make them more prone to poverty, for example spatially segregated from the rest of the city,

14. The street structure can be changed and along connecting streets neighbourly relations are likely to increase; it is argued that micro-level phenomena produce macro-level outcomes (Grannis 1998: 1560). The mix of local inhabitants and non-locals is important since the information and knowledge that incomers may bring to an area are different from ‘provincial news and views’. Such information from elsewhere is believed to be important, for example, in obtaining a job, which in the debate of social integration and exclusion is a critical issue (Granovetter 1983).

16. From an architectural perspective, we can identify public space as a key variable for facilitating important social processes in cities that can support long-term social inclusion We believe the Gothenburg study contributes to earlier research concerning the relation between spatial configuration and the intensity of co-presence.

18. Naturally this accessibility depends on the location of such amenities but, by applying the place syntax approach, it can be clearly demonstrated the extent to which this also depends on the spatial configuration itself, increasing the toolbox of urban planning and design. The principles of neighbourhood unit planning included the provision of a high level of service for itsinhabitants but not for a greater ‘audience’, meaning that non-locals and other ‘strangers’ were not encouraged to pass through or visit the area.

20. The empirical data from the co-presence study confirms that in most of the squares a large share of those co-present live very close to the square, and thus the inflow of people living elsewhere is low. The urban design interventions analysed in this study supported, on the one hand, the distribution of resources more effectively in space, increasing their likelihood of improving life chances locally.
