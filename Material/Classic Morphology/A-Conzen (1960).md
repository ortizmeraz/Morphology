## Bullet points
1. Fucntionally the geographer character of a town is determined by economic and social significance within some regional context .
2. Morphologically it finds expression in the physiognomy or townscape, which is a combination of town plan, pattern of building forms, and pattern of urban land use. All these aspects have been the subject of geographical investigation. 
3. As a result our geographical comprehension of townscapes is hampered by the lack of a theorethical basis yielding concepts of general application. 
4. In this connection it is fundamental to establish what we mean by a 'town plan'. It is necessary to take a more comprehensive vire of this term taking account of relevant geographical detail. In the past many studies of plans have been restricted to the consideration of the streets or street spaces only a method which has its roots largely in an earlier architectural preoccupation with the structure of street-blocks has been ignored as if this were not geographically relevant.
5. A town plan can be defined, therefore, as the topographical arrangement of an urban built-up area in all its man-made features. It contains three distinct complexes of plan elements:
	1. streets and their arrangement in a street-system;
	2. plots and their aggregation in street-blocks; and
	3. buildings or, more precisely, their block-plans. 
6. The areas within the town plan unoccupied by streets and bounded wholly or in part by street-lines are the street-blocks.
7. Examination of the town plan shows that the three element complexes of streets, plots and buildings enter individualized combination in different areas of the town.
8. Finally, it is important to realize that town plans originate, develop, and function within a physical and human context without which they remain incomprehensible. Therefore, plan analysis properly includes the evaluation of physical conditions of site and situation as well as of relevant economic and social development. The latter, indeed, provides the background for the interdependence of plan, building fabric, and land use, and the bridge between the morphological and the functional approaches in urban geography.
