Abstract: Significant efforts have been dedicated to studying the linkages between urban form, fossil energy consumption, and climate change. The theme of urban sprawl helped to federate a significant portion of such efforts. Yet, the research  appears fragmented, at stems from different disciplines and mobilizes different methods to probe different aspects of the issue. This paper seeks to better understand the status of knowledge concerning the linkages between sprawl and climate change through a critical review of the literature published between 1979 and 2018. The exercise entailed revisiting how sprawl has been defined, characterized and measured, and how such parameters have informed the research themes and the approaches mobilized to study its impacts on climate change. For, sprawled environments contribute the climate change directly and indirectly, due to the individual or combined effects of its land use, land cover, urban form, and transportation characteristics. The results indicate that sprawl’s impacts have been mainly investigated in three principal streams of research and based on a limited number of factors or combinations of factors. Though a strong consensus emerges on the negative environmental costs of sprawl, including toward climate change, there remain ambiguities when trying to untangle and weigh specific causes.

2. This research aimed at answering a pretty straightforward question: “what does the research say about the links between urban sprawl and climate change.”
3. The determination of the impacts of urban sprawl on climate change and their measurement can, and do, vary significantly depending on how sprawl itself is conceptualized and measured.
4. Page 2
5. This paper presents key conclusions stemming from a survey of pertinent literature probing the links between urban sprawl and climate change.
6. It sets about, firstly, to bring some conceptual clarity to the notion of sprawl, while charting, secondly, the scientific production that addresses direct and indirect links between the latter and climate change.
7. Those links are examined through the lenses of energy consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. A conceptual diagram has proposed that charts what we deem the physical planning drivers of climate change as well as their direct, indirect, and combined impacts.A two-pronged approach was adopted for identifying and analyzing the pertinent literature probing the linkages between urban sprawl and climate change.
8. The first step centered on 7 literature reviews published between 1994 to 2015
9. The second step entailed conducting a search relying on ISI’s Web of Science®® database from 1979 until 2018.
10. The exercise prioritized quantitative studies concerned with the material and spatial manifestations of sprawl in relation to outputs that contribute to climate change while excluding studies centered on economic, social, cultural, or technological factors.
11. North American contexts have been given more weight compared to other settings.

15. There is an overwhelming consensus to the effect that the GHG emissions caused by human activities are the most important cause of climate change [6,10–14]. Among all of the GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most detrimental contributor to global climate change [6,15,16].
16. Cities are already responsible for approximately 80% of the overall GHG/CO2 emissions [18], while urbanized populations are expected to double, as rural populations level off or decline [19] (p.3133).

18. Defining, Characterizing, and Measuring Sprawl
19. Defining Sprawl
20. The forms assumed by urbanization have evidently evolved in the course of history.
21. For thousands of years, the forms of cities had been essentially predicated on walking.
22. Yet, even the most populous cities displayed a spatial extension limited to a radius of 5 km or so, corresponding to an hour of walking from the periphery to the center. Such cities had to “grow from within,” which entailed increased densities of populations, buildings, and activities.
23. Urban sprawl has been discussed and researched from a wide diversity of perspectives in the urban studies and planning literature. Once described as an “American zeitgeist” [24], sprawl is becoming a global phenomenon. Sprawl has been substantially altering the physical and spatial structures as well as the functioning of cities where it prevails, though the rates and patterns of sprawl vary in different parts of the world.
24. The definitions of sprawl are strongly informed by the disciplinary, theoretical, and epistemological perspectives of the definers [35] (p. 3). Moreover, the term alternatively refers to a process, an outcome, or to specific material and spatial manifestations.
25. Page 5
26. Sprawl manifests patterns of land development marked by low-intensity (expressed in densities of population and activities) and spatially segregated land uses (comprised of residential and other functions such as commercial, leisure, and economic production). Such spatial patterns are enabled by, and heavily dependent on, automobility. Sprawl is often contrasted with and compared (in qualitative and quantitative terms) to its polar opposite, deemed the “compact city.”
27. Page 6
28. the term sprawl denotes an urbanization process that produces low-intensity modes of occupation of the land. [Sprawl] is characterized by built and spatial forms that are suboptimal in serving their purposes when taking into consideration their geographical, cultural, and technological contexts and local historical precedents” [36] (p. 16).
29. Measuring Sprawl Key Characteristics
30. Pendall stated that “the measurement of sprawl is not straightforward, partly because of the variation in how sprawl is defined” [39] (p. 558).
31. The early research, prior to the year 2000, was crude and unidimensional, exclusively or merely focusing on density; the 2001–2010 period has featured multi-level, multi-dimensional, and multi-disciplinary approaches; the subsequent stage from 2011 aimed also to tackle changes or trends in the degrees of urban sprawl [2].
32. Sprawl is characterized by intertwined sets of characters that interact with and influence each other.
33. The most common categories of variables mobilized to measure properties associated with the three main characters of sprawl have been identified, by relying on inductive and deductive reasoning while probing the literature on sprawl characterization and measurement. Table 3 summarizes these findings.

37. Land use variables are routinely referred to as the so-called “D variables.” They are centered on the compositional and configurational characteristics of the land allocation in a geographical area of reference, as well as on accessibility to specific amenities (jobs, transit stops) or overall accessibility by foot (relying on topological variables as proxies).
38. Cervero and Kochelman coined the original expression “three Ds,” which stands for: density, diversity (land-use composition), and design (accessibility based on a place’s spatial characteristics)
39. The land use variables are typically measured at the neighborhood scale by using census data, agency data, or data that can be derived from GIS.
40. Sprawl is almost indissociable from heavy reliance on automobiles.

42. Sprawl and Climate Change
43. The Impacts of Urban Density on Fossil Energy Consumption and GHG/CO2 Emissions Density was and still is one of the most widely used indicators to measure land-use and urban form intensity.
44. The second line of inquiry centers on the energy consumption and emissions of the buildings themselves (heating, cooling, etc.) depending on the density.
45. Page 9
46. Low-density residential environments composed of single-family houses are a defining characteristic of sprawl. Many scholars investigate the relationship between residential density, the level of GHG emissions related to both transportation patterns and building energy use [49–52].
47. Low-density, detached single-family buildings and urban fabrics are associated with higher energy consumption and GHG/CO2 emissions, but specific contributing factors are difficult to untangle and measure precisely.
48. Page 11
49. The term land use refers to the composition and configurations of the land surface utilization (for housing, work, leisure, transportation, etc.). Land cover denotes the nature and the composition of the surface on the ground (such as forest land, grassland, wetlands,anthropogenic biomes of crops, or artificial infrastructures and buildings).
50. Sprawl entails massive land cover changes involving the artificialization of natural or cultivated land. Such transformations translate into deforestation and grasslands losses; loss of valuable arable land; the creation of extensive impervious surfaces and; extensive construction of buildings and roads.
51. Sprawl would have been impossible at its current scale without heavy reliance on the automobile. The general consensus in the literature is that sprawled urban forms generate more car travel and entails greater energy consumption and more GHG/CO2 emissions as a consequence [4,6,19].
52. Page 15
53. While the consensus is strong about the environmental costs of sprawl and its contribution to climate change, there exists a number of gaps, limitations, and seemingly diverging interpretations on a limited number of specific aspects.
54. Another issue stems from entangled factors and conditions in sprawled environments (or their polar opposite the compact city). Higher urban density for instance is generally accompanied by mixed land uses and better public transit, so that variables measuring those aspects tend to correlate with one another [55], and with fossil energy use and GHG/CO2 emissions.
55. Discussion
56. Any serious attempts to measure the impacts of urbanized habitats on the environment, or to intervene on such issues with the aims of reducing their environmental footprints or to build-up resilience, require a deep understanding of the urban material and spatial forms that are manifested in the contemporary city.
57. Proper theorization and characterization of the urban built environments constitute an essential facet of any such research effort.
58. Firstly, lacking proper theorization of urban form often leads to a crudely approximative characterization and quantification of spatial conditions (e.g., the widespread use of density indicators that does not account for the variability of spatial composition and configuration in which the same density can be manifested).
59. Page 16
60. Secondly, sprawl should be and can only be fully understood in relative terms spatially, geographically, culturally, and temporarily. Sprawl can assume very different meanings in different geographical and cultural contexts, or in different urbanization development phases. Cities and regions sprawl differently by presenting varying patterns, rates, extents, and trends of sprawl.
61. Thirdly, the terms “sprawl” and “compact city” have been used to represent polar opposites situated at the ends of a spectrum. This raises several complex theoretical and methodological questions and poses significant challenges for the operationalization of these concepts, both for analytical and applied purposes.
62. Morphologically speaking, such a dichotomic representation is fallacious. A city’s spatial expansion over time produces a variety of urban configurations and combinatory patterns.
63. These research efforts address different aspects of those relationships by pointing to a variety of direct and indirect links, depending on the factors and combination of factors considered.
64. Highlighting three main streams of research contributes to bringing some clarity. Those coincide roughly with the three main characteristics of sprawl highlighted in the literature centered on that phenomenon.
65. The latter considerations produce some “noise” and seemingly incongruent results, as variables used to measure land use, including density, urban form properties, and transportation tend to correlate with one another in “pure” sprawled, or compact, contexts, but express more elusive interrelations in less archetypical configurations, or when measured against different spatial partitioning (scale and spatial boundaries).
66. There is a growing consensus on the need to develop combined strategies that consider transportation, land-use, and urban form synergies [6,67,68]. Based on the literature reviewed, this is the way to go to cope with the inherent complexities of sprawl.
