## Abstract
```ad-abstract
Urban morphology is a thriving field of enquiry involving researchers from a wide diversity of disciplinary, linguistic and cultural backgrounds. While this diversity has helped advance our understanding of the complexity of urban form, confusion and controversy has also arisen over the various theoretical formulations forwarded by researchers from different philosophical and epistemological backgrounds. With the aim of improving intelligibility in the field, this paper proposes a straightforward scheme to identify, classify and interpret, or ‘map’, **individual contributions** to the study of urban form according to their respective theoretical or epistemological perspectives. Drawing upon epistemological discussions familiar to the readers of this journal, the authors first distinguish between **cognitive** and **normative** studies. A second distinction is made between **internalist studies** that consider urban form as a relatively independent system, and **externalist** studies in which urban form stands as a passive product of various external determinants. Using these basic criteria, it is possible to interpret and synthesize a multitude of contributions and map them using a simple Cartesian grid. The paper highlights how contributions from seemingly different theoretical approaches to urban morphology are intrinsically similar in their treatment of urban form as an object of enquiry.

## Bullet points
1.  Urban morphology, in simple terms, is the study of city forms. While there is general agreement among self-proclaimed ‘urban morphologists’ as to what they study, there is considerable debate over how urban forms are to be studied.

2. …one of the most urgent requirements in the field of urban morphology is the elucidation of its philosophical or epistemological foundations (Conzen, 1998; Gerosa, 1999; Whitehand, 1999).

3. … we propose a system to identify and interpret, or ‘map’, individual contributions to the study of urban form according to their respective theoretical or epistemological perspectives. In an effort to ‘improve intelligibility’ in urban morphology, we offer a two-tiered examination of prevailing approaches in the field.

4. First, there are studies that are aimed at providing explanations or developing explanatory frameworks or both (i.e. **[[cognitive]]** contributions);

5. We use the expression cognitive to reflect the heuristic nature of an intellectual enterprise concerned with producing knowledge or at developing theoretical means, methods and techniques destined to produce such knowledge

6. … and secondly, there are studies aimed at determining the modalities according to which the city should be planned or built in the future (i.e. **[[normative]]** contributions).

7. … the term normative denotes accurately an intellectual exercise, which aims at articulating a view of what the future should look like, or at exposing a doctrine or specific sets of norms and prescriptions that would serve such a view.

8. We posit that differentiating between cognitive and normative studies is a critical step for clarifying the multi-faceted nature of the intellectual agenda of urban morphology.

9. The field of urban morphology lies at the intersection of several academic disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, geography and history.

10. Urban planning is a case in point, and one in which the problem of the heuristic programmes and procedures is raised quite acutely. As a practice, urban planning is clearly oriented towards action, whereas as a scholarly subject matter, it assumes a more complex and ambiguous character. The discipline of urban planning seems to possess a mixed identity: science, applied science and prescriptive practice (Levy and Spigai, 1989).

11. To distinguish between **[[cognitive]]** and **[[normative]]** approaches does much to clarify the nature of the intellectual contribution of the school of process typology, as exemplified by the ideas of Italian architect Saverio Muratori.

12. each contribution is sorted according to the epistemic status conferred to urban form: by distinguishing between contributions that consider urban form as a relatively independent system, and contributions in which urban form stands as a dependent variable, or passive product of various external determinants.

13. To comprehend the urban fabric in terms of ‘urban form’, understood as a system of its own that is governed by internal sets of relations, necessitates two prerequisites: first, that the elements in the system are not discrete objects; and secondly, that the relations between elements are not contingent. In other words, there exists an ‘internal’ logic to this system.

14. We propose to call these approaches that are primarily concerned with understanding the **[[internal]]** logic of the urban fabric internalist approaches to urban morphology.

15. Alternatively, we label as **[[externalist]]** those approaches that primarily see the urban form as the end product of processes driven by political (e.g. Çelik, 1997), anthropological (e.g. Rapoport, 1977, 1982; Rykwert, 1988), geographical and economic (e.g. Vance, 1977, 1990), historical (e.g. Benevolo, 1980), and perceptual (e.g. Lynch and Rodwin, 1958; Lynch, 1960) determinants.

16. Perhaps the most important contribution of urban morphology to the study of cities has been to show how the built environment can be understood as a system of relations submitted to rules of transformation.

17. At a practical level, the grid allows for a synthetic representation of some commonalities and distinctions observable in the theoretical and epistemological perspectives favoured in various contributions. Such mapping is beneficial as it provides an immediate basis for comparison when faced with the corpus of contributions emanating from a variety of disciplinary traditions and linguistic environments.

18. A closer look at the grid reveals that the **internalist/cognitive** quadrant includes various **scientific studies** concerned with **the city as an artifact and spatial form**, and which conceptualize its built environment as a system.

19. The **externalist/cognitive** quadrant regroups the scientific contributions concerned with the forms and **transformations** of the urban built environment, but **which rely predominantly on explanatory frameworks based on external conditions** of development.

20. The studies categorized as **internalist/normative** could be otherwise qualified as **urban design normative contributions,** as they aim at devising an urban form that has **yet to be built**.

21. In the **externalist/normative** quadrant group are studies that develop **applied approaches** to the processes dealing with the **making of urban fabrics**.
