## Notes
1. Some current approaches to teaching architectural composition, including our own, are directly or indirectly descended from Saverio Muratori’s thought, teaching and research, and took the role of the discipline to be completely the opposite. Therefore, let us try ti state our cultural standpoint and the resulting research and teaching methodology. P.30

2. In fact, at present building is characterized by a major discontinuity of products and intentions which, when put into practice, leads to urban aggregates consisting of highly personalized, scarcely related objects. P.31

3. The term ‘consciousness’ expresses ‘the immediate faculty to realise, grasp and assess facts that occur in individual experience or that loom up in the near future, generally speaking, knowledge, evaluative consciousness’. By **spontaneous consciousness** we mean, in particular, the attitude of individuals adapting, in their work, to their inherited civil substance, without needing or requiring mediations or choices… **Spontaneous building** includes the immediate, concise comprehension of what occurs to form a building product. ….. When someone builds their own house with their own hands, they do not follow the dictates of the various architectural schools or currents and do not choose to build it out of structural steel tree trunks without distinction: they do it as a house is built at that particular moment and in their own cultural area, thus acting in full **spontaneous consciousness**. P40

4. Acting with **critical consciousness** is almost the opposite (to **spontaneous consciousness**): when we are going through one of those critical periods, as mentioned in the introduction as present in a civil structure, people are obliged to choose what ther are doing…. In brief, they have to deliberate because they have no firmly established way of acting. P40

5. We can take **yield** to mean the dialectic relationship between a human action and an environmental reaction. P43

6. If we then look at former portions of even more conservative aggregates (tor di Nona in Rome, for example), we can see that the dual cell in depth can be interpreted as an innovation of the previous mono-cellular, two-story type, whose vestiges can in turn be interpreted as innovative vis-à-vis a former mono-cellular type with one single ground floor and one single entrance door acting both as an entrance to the single room and as a surface providing air and light. This is the **[[base type]],** which we can still find in certain…. This reveals an essential characteristic in applying the ‘type’ notion to the interpretation of buildings pertaining to an aggregate: interpretation can be more or less in-depth and can be based on small differentiations, but also on huge differences P.81

7. In fact, the ‘base type’ has, in turn, a formative history, produced by the **[[elementary cell]]**, a room of the same size that has come to form part od a derived, more developed type. We find these types reduced every time we would like to interpret aggregates on the edges of civil development, particularly in minimal season buildings in summer pastures where a ‘night shelter’ is required more than a ‘house’.P.84

8. A **[[specialized building]]**, therefore, is conditioned by a type, pertaining to a specific typological process, which is a branch of the general typological process, a typological series. . . . As long as we remain in the field of basic buildings, family residences, these intentions and this specialization can only grow to a certain extent on account of the substantial correlation between existence and house, which does not accept variations beyond a certain limit, constantly conditioned by the immanence of a ‘basic type’ pertaining to a stricter process of change than the formation and transformation processes of specialized types… P.91

9. It is wise to refer once again to the distinction between a **base type** – the mono-cellular type of approximately 5 x 5.6 m – and an **elementary cell**, the structure originating from the base type of similar size and function, but each time associated with other similar cells to form subsequent types, sprung from the ‘base type’ by virtue of the law that we called ‘successive doublings’.P.91

10. ‘Building’ and ‘type’ are interrelated through the ‘level of specificity’ concept, which has been touched upon. For enlightened or positivist critics, the difference between ‘type’ and ‘building’ is evident. It is associated with another distinction between ‘type’ and ‘model’, where **[[type]]** represents an abstract, distributional, functional or formal scheme and **[[building]]** represents an object that actually exists, is built and more or less coincides (in that, by existing, it can be wholly or partially imitated in the production of another building) with the term **[[model]]**. Therefor ‘type’ seems possible only as an a posteriori, analytical evaluation of [a] model building. In our opinion, Muratori’s definition of building type as an a[-]prior synthesis resolves that dichotomy. In that sense, type is not an abstract grid to which a building has to adhere; if this were the case, a scheme could not represent the building or the totality complex relations of an existing building. P.92

11. The **maximum level of specificity** is theoretically obtained whenever I manage to identify one single object with all its attributes and with all its characteristics, making it somehow completely opposable to other objects, albeit very similar. Only at his point shall I have the similarity between a [[building type]] and a building, and only then shall I have critically reached type entirely existing at the level of spontaneous consciousness in the minds of builders; at the same time, I shall have fully understood all characteristics of that building. P.93

12. **[[Routes]]**. Every building needs to be linked to others: we can state in absolute terms **that there cannot be a building without a route** providing access, regardless of whether or not it is aggregated to others. … A ‘route’ is, by definition**, a structure suited to providing access to a place**, starting from another. The knowledge of route closely involves basic and specialized building typologies in the sense that ‘route’ or ‘pathway’ describes not only the connecting structure between various rooms for a specific use but also the structure contained in each room, permitting its internal use as well as entrance. P.105

13. As we call ‘pertinent area’ the area annexed to each type (e.g., the ‘backyard’), we shall call **pertinent strip** the area inherent to each route that contains the built lots that face it and are served by it. P.108

14. It is advisable to recall the definition terms for node and nodal points, pole and polarity. By ‘node’ we mean any single point in a continuum, often determined by the intersection between two continua or by the budding of a continuum from another; the term, commonly used in Italian to indicate a knot in a rope or know between two ropes, express this characteristic very well. Therefore, if by, ’continuum’ we mean a route, a ‘node’ will be the intersection between the two routes or a Y-junction or even the impact between two different kinds of continuum, for instance a brisge or a ford, involving an intersection between a road and a waterway. ‘Nodality’ is the quality that derives at as single point from the fact that it is a ‘node’ or junction. ‘Pole’ is a sublimation of the term ‘node’, generally determined by the existence of several continua not so much intersecting as terminating or starting from a point; ‘polarity’ is the resulting equality.P.109

15. However, it is wise to take particular note of the essential consequence of tracing ‘connecting routes’: the final achievement of the **block** concept as the most eye-catching and widely use of module of the urban aggregate. In a certain sense, it is also the most questionable because it will soon be clear from the genesis reconstructed through route typology that blocks are progressively determined by the coordination between several pertinent strips of each route and that each pertinent strip is definitely more cohesive and consistent with the reciprocal one, inherent to the route itself, than those re-emerged in the block. P114-115

16. Builders and townsmen are aware of the pre-eminence of built-up routes over blocks, at least until a drop in the aggregate’s component ends up by prevailing, with a consequent loss of connections with its history-structure: even the mere fact of creating names, the terms suburb and above all quarter, indicates that the module of genesis and development of the aggregate is the built-up route and not the block. P115

17. This means that a basic tissue, a matrix for further development, has to refer to a route lined with ‘base type’ buildings whose longitudinal development is limited by the need to start interpolating planned building routes; actually, any tissue can be traced back to this matrix, which continues to be constituent and present as an elementary module in any aggregate, no matter how it has developed or specialized. P.115

18. A **[[break-through route]]** is that type of route that overlaps a previous building tissue as soon as a direct link between pre-existing polarities or additional polarities in the aggregate is considered necessary and whenever a previous matrix route does not already ensure this link.

19. In any case, I shall have to record the relative centrality or peripherality of a house, even though this centrality or peripherality is referenced from a node consisting of the simple planned building route on a matrix route, an elementary crossroads between two routes and not really in relation to the centre or outskirts of the entire nucleus.
