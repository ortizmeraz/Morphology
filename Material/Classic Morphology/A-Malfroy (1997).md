## Bullet points
1. The conceptual framework developed by Gianfranco Caniggia for describing the development of the built environment is extremely the rich. It distinguishes, amongst other things, levels of scale, classes of routes and plot patterns, and analyzes the processes of formation and transformation of buildings.
2. ... however, the question of space is never raised in the theoretical texts of Caniggia and his school.
3. The omission of the spatial element is a weakness in as much as it gives the Caniggian methodology a strangely anachronistic and distant character with regard to the central preoccupations of the architectural debate:...
4. In order to reassure ourselves as to the utility of pursuing the dialogue with the Caniggian enterprise, it suffices to read a work that is marked by the exact opposite fault, Collage City by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter.
5. The built environment decoded in the language of the psychology of form (Gestalt) singularly lacks substance.
6. It will not do, then, to side with Rowe and Koetter. Rather, the task consists in elaborating the complementarity of the two approaches.
7. Caniggia, and Rowe and Koetter, have in common a very critical attitude towards the modern practice of design (especially post-war design), a practice that wavers between scientific rigour and creative freedom, sometimes hiding the freedom under the guise of the science.
8. The authors differ in the models of integration that they propose. Caniggia opts for the recuperation of anonymous buildings...
9. Rowe and Koetter recommend a culture of pluralist “bricolage’, nourished by the latest teachings of history...
10. With Caniggia, we have a theory of design that is suspicious of architectural élites...
11. Opposed to this increasing dominance of expressive designs over the city, Caniggia recommends the recuperation of local traditions of construction
12. For Rowe and Koetter, the utopia of a unitary order imposed on the built environment according to a single criterion of rationality (or a single set of values) is a much greater danger than the break-up of the built environment in a multiplicity of partial and fragmentary orders.
13. These traditions have their particular place in a model of pluralism. Put simply, one can no longer seek to universalize them.
14. ..., as a morphological approach to the constitution and transformation of artistic forms has existed for some time in the history of art (even if one might think that this realm is fundamentally resistant to such a point of view), so in the realm of built form one might expect fertile results if one were to hypothesize that the anonymous structures elaborated over the long term, and more recent projects, do not form distinct, hermetic categories but might be integrated in a unitary theory of the genesis of built forms.
