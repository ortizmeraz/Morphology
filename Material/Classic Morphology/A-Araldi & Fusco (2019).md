## Abstract
```ad-abstract
The urban fabric is a fundamental small-scale component of urban form. Its quantitative analysi has so far been limited either in its geographical extent or in the diversity of components analysed. Moreover, the planning approach has traditionally privileged an aerial perspective. A new approach integrating the pedestrian point of view is proposed. Spatial analysis procedures are implemented with a twofold objective: identifying **[[urban fabric]]s** and studying their spatial organization within a large **metropolitan area**. The former is achieved through **multiple fabric assessment**, a three-step protocol using a network-based partition of urban space: (i) a set of skeletal streetscape indicators is implemented on each spatial unit, considering different constituents of the urban fabric; (ii) spatial patterns on the street network are identified, applying geostatistical analysis to each indicator; and (iii) spatial patterns with Bayesian clustering are recombined, allowing the identification and characterization of urban fabric types and subspaces within the city. This methodology is tested on the French Riviera metropolitan area, where nine families of urban fabric are identified. Disentangling the spatial organization of urban fabrics represents the second objective of this paper: the geographical distribution of urban fabrics is investigated, applying mathematical morphology and variography while considering networkconstrained topological contiguities.

2. Since Jacobs (1961) defended the idea that modern planning did not take into account the needs of city-dwellers,... This is also true in the study of the physical form of the city, as pioneered by Lynch (1960). The pedestrian point of view is thus integrated into the analysis of urban spaces, focusing more specifically on the study of streetscapes.
3. ... streetscapes are not the only feature of urban form, and their morphological characteristics need to be put into the urban context where they are measured.
4. Urban morphologists proposed to study urban contexts through the analysis of the urban fabric, which is defined as a specific combination of local patterns made up of buildings, streets and plots and considered as the original and unique outcome of conscious and unconscious design of the physical city (Caniggia and Maffei, 1979).
5. In turn, different types of urban fabric must be understood in the context of morphological regions (Conzen, 1960), revealing the multi-scale structuring of urban form.
6. In contrast, configurational approaches like Space Syntax (SSx) capture the pedestrian perspective, but do not focus on the urban fabric as defined by urban morphologists.
7. Innovative approaches from other disciplines could bring several solutions that would allow traditional urban fabric analysis to fully integrate the pedestrian perspective.
8. ...geographers have already adapted several geostatistical approaches to network-constrained space, being aware of its importance for the study of human activity in the city (Okabe and Sugihara, 2012).
9. The main goal of our paper is to present a new computer-aided methodology for the study of urban fabric,
10. Page 3
11. The concept of the morphological region is also proposed to describe urban sectors characterized by consistent extents of a single urban fabric and to produce more global schemes of the morphological organization of the city.
12. ..., the approach of classical urban morphologists to study the urban fabric left little space for the pedestrian perception of the physical city.
13. Lynch’s (1960) seminal work established little link between the perception of cityscapes and the analysis of the urban fabric.
14. SSx (Hillier, 1996; Hillier and Hanson, 1984) proposed the most innovative reconceptualization of urban form analysis by focusing on the open space available for pedestrians. The urban open space is partitioned into convex polygons approximated with visual axial lines.
15. Topological measurements of centrality are carried out on the resulting graph, which is a dual representation of the axial line network. The use of visual lines and the natural movement theory might be considered as an integration of the pedestrian perspective applied to the analysis of urban form, and in SSx this is even truer than for MCA.

17. Following the founding concept of urban fabric, the reviewed methods aim to describe in different ways the arrangements of buildings, plots and streets.
18. Despite differences in the final goal and spatial unit choice, these methodologies share a similar multivariate approach based on the cross-analysis of different dimensions of urban form components, like their density and geometrical properties.
19. Typo-morphologies of city blocks represent the main outcomes of these methodologies. Another important phase in geoprocessing of the urban fabric is the computer-aided algorithms used to identify different empirical typologies of city blocks: spacematrix diagrams (Berghauser-Pont and Haupt, 2010), k-means (Bernabe´ et al., 2013; Gil et al., 2012; Vialard, 2013)

21. the skeletal streetscape, defined as the main geometric characteristics of buildings and trees along the streets (size, spacing, frequency, etc.). The skeletal streetscape provides the structural support onto which the skin, made of design details, is fitted, completing the description of the streetscape.
22. In conclusion, streetscape analysis, whether limited to the skeletal structure or extending to include other constituents, focuses on the street–building interface and ignores both the content of buildings and the urban fabric as a whole.
23. Our first need is to define a new spatial unit putting the street at the centre of the analysis Urban form indicators should be conceived and redefined from this perspective.
24. ... other important aspects of the urban fabric, well-identified by classical urban morphology schools,
25. Finally, the urban fabric will be defined as a morphologically attentive urban streetscape.
26. ... the pedestrian perspective to define the urban fabric should not simply be reduced to the capacities of human vision.
27. Each indicator, describing a geometrical aspect of urban form within a spatial unit, should be evaluated considering its spatial distribution and variation.
28. Geostatistical analysis on street networks might then provide methodological solutions for the study of spatial heterogeneity/homogeneity of perceivable morphological characteristics and serve as the input for subsequent clustering models.
29. Page 6
30. Finally, types of urban fabric defined as morphological streetscapes might be characterized by specific sub-groups of morphological patterns, which may vary from one subspace to another.
31. Urban fabric identification:
32. A new methodology MFA is a new methodology for the identification and characterization of different urban fabrics within a large study area (see Supplemental Appendix Figure S2). After defining appropriate goal-specific spatial units (1), it can be summed up as follows: (2.a) geoprocessing protocols to calculate a matrix of morphological indicators of the urban fabric; (2.b) identification of spatial associations of indicator values (local patterns) on a network constrained space; (2.c) clustering of local patterns through Bayesian methods. The outcomes of MFA allow the identification of urban fabrics in large study areas (3.a) and the study of their spatial organization (3.b).
33. ... when analysing urban fabrics through geoprocessing, we first need to define the base spatial unit.
34. In her study of the block-face, Vialard (2013) also proposed a morphological description of elements within a one-sided buffer, going from the street-edge to the block interior. Here, centrelines and street-edges assume a major value of geometrical reference for the description of the urban fabric.
35. Page 7
36. Spatial contiguities between these street centred fragments of urban space should be reintroduced to explore their spatial variability.
37. Studying different issues from urban form Okabe and Sugihara (2012) proposed a similar partition of urban space, namely network-based Thiessen tessellation, with the intent of redistributing socio-demographic data on the street network.
38. A generalization of Thiessen polygons is created around each street segment, to identify the portion of planar space conventionally served by each segment.
39. Only the closest space to street-edges can be observed by pedestrians. A double-sided buffer approximating to visible space is selected from the Thiessen partition (Figure 1). The resulting partition, the proximity bands (PBs) considers different visual depths, depending on the specific aspect of the urban fabric under analysis (‘Decomposing urban fabric components’ section).

41. Selection criteria of indicators are the relevance and complementarity of the information carried by each of them when describing the urban fabric following the theory of urban morphology analysis (Borie and Denieul, 1984)
42. Network morphology is analysed through the street segment Length and Linearity (or inversely, its Windingness) (Harvey and Aultman-Hall, 2016). Three indicators measure the Local Connectivity of the street network: each street junction is described by Boolean values that indicate the presence/absence of nodes of degree one (cul-de-sac), four (crossings) and other (mainly bifurcations).
43. Built up morphology is studied within a 50 m wide PB and is first characterized by the traditional building Coverage Ratio index (Berghauser-Pont and Haupt, 2010). This indicator is then enriched by information about Built-up Type prevalence. The building footprint area is used as a proxy for categorization of buildings (Sevtsuk, 2014).
44. Site Morphology measures the presence of steeply sloped surfaces in the 50 m PB.
45. Network–Building Relationship indicators describe the building geometry analysed in relation to the street segment. For this reason, they are computed on narrower PBs of 10 or 20 m. They include the Street Corridor Effect (Araldi and Fusco, 2016), as a ratio between the total length of parallel fac¸ ades and the street segment (similar to Harvey and Aultman Hall, 2016 and Vialard, 2013, only considering parallel fac¸ ades); PB Building Height (Berghauser-Pont and Haupt, 2010); Open Space Width; Height/Width Ratio (Harvey and Aultman-Hall, 2016). The Building frequency along the street network informs us about the serial vision of different buildings along a street (Hallowell and Baran, 2013). Following the same approach, Land ownership fragmentation is used as an indicator of the Network–Plot Relationship.
46. the relationship between street Network and Site Morphology is analysed through Street Acclivity. Plot morphology per se, although central to the study of morphogenetic processes (Caniggia and Maffei, 1979; Conzen, 1960) is considered less relevant for pedestrian perception.

48. Local indicators of spatial association (LISA; Anselin, 1995) characterize the spatial autocorrelation of values around each unit using a local computation of Moran’s Indicator.

50. This paper presented MFA, a new methodology for the analysis of the urban fabric, MFA is characterized by three main methodological innovations.
51. First, the definition of morphological indicators for PBs, integrating the pedestrian point of view of the urban fabric.
52. Second, geostatistical analysis is used to transform quantitative local measurements in categorical network-based patterns that are later used as inputs for clustering.
53. Third, unlike more traditional approaches, Bayesian clustering considers specific subsets of indicators for each class identified.
54. The method proved successful in the identification of urban fabrics and their spatial arrangements in the real-world case of the French Riviera metropolitan area.
55. The combination of geostatistics and Bayesian clustering represents an innovative procedure which is not limited to our definition of spatial units. These two approaches could also be applied to other spatial partitions, more appropriate for other research goals (i.e. block-, plot- or building-based partitions).
56. In our analyses of the physical city’s form, we drew a careful distinction between the study of the urban fabric and that of the configurational properties of street networks. MFA is devoted solely to the former.

58. The street network-based partition of MFA shares the same primal representation as MCA in configurational studies. Their combination is therefore easily achievable. Some adaptation is needed when results from MFA and SSx are combined.
