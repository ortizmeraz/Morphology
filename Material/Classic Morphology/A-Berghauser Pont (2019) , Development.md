## Abstract
```ad-abstract
A better understanding of the relationship between the built environment and urban processes is central in guiding urban processes in more sustainable trajectories. Of particular importance to this endeavour is the idea of **urban types**. However, on closer scrutiny, while such types may capture the symbolic dimension of urban form, they frequently do not capture its performance or functional dimension. This prohibits precise policy formulation on the topic. This paper first presents a methodology for generating urban types relevant to urban practice (using analytical and statistical methods) and, second, an empirical test of the differences in performance concerning their influence on the presence of people in public space (an essential driver of many other urban processes). For this reason, a large (and to our knowledge unique) pedestrian survey of three European metropolitan areas was conducted and used to test the performance of the urban types developed. The results prove that the methodology for developing the types is robust, as it picks up generally recognised spatial patterns in all three cities. Further, the types were able to explain the intensity of pedestrian flow, its spatial distribution and fluctuations of intensity in space and time. These are vital steps forward and provide more useable typologies in urban planning and design practice.

2. In this paper, we continue a long-term endeavour to bring these approaches closer to each other under a common framework of spatial morphology on closer scrutiny such types are typically heuristic and vague, capturing the symbolic dimension rather than the performance or functional dimension.
3. the aim of this paper is to develop a systematic and rigorous methodology for generating urban types relevant to urban practice and to then empirically test the differences in performance when it comes to their influence on the presence of people in public space, which is an essential driver of many other urban processes (cf. Hillier et al., 1993).
4. Typologies play a role in both urban planning and design practice and in public debate on urban development. However, analytically we argue that they remain weak in acknowledging the complexity of real urban environments.
5. Typical typo-morphological studies use descriptive and deductive methods.
6. ... does not immediately support more stringent comparisons or tie such descriptions to their performance (Moudon, 1994)
7. Page 3
8. the aim of this paper is to develop a typology relevant to urban design practice, it should combine both fine-scale data, incorporating premises relevant to urban design practice and large-extent analysis,
9. First, the types need to be developed using morphological units that are important to design practice and which can be grouped into two distinct urban spaces: (1) a continuous and publicly accessible space of streets, primarily used for movement and (2) a discontinuous space, comprising plots and buildings used for the generic function of long-term occupation (Hillier, 1996).
10. Second, these units need to be treated separately, so as to study their role in urban processes alone and in combination.
11. Third, the measures used to generate the types need to capture both the form and pattern of the (local) built environment and its position in the larger urban context. These three requirements have led to the choice of two morphological units: streets and buildings.
12. ... density is often discussed as a good indicator of the intensity of activities and movement in cities (cf. Jenks and Burgess, 2004; Ozbil et al.,2011) and therefore especially relevant to our purpose.
13. Following the latest methodological developments in the field of space syntax, angular betweenness centrality is used in this paper to describe street configuration. It measures the sum of the shortest path overlaps for a particular street segment, Angular distance has proven more powerful in predicting pedestrian movement than measures using metric or topological distance (Hillier and Iida, 2005; Hillier et al.,2012; Turner, 2007).
14. [[FSI]] is used to describe the total built floor space in an area
15. [[GSI]] describes the division between built and non-built land in an area
16. Because we are interested in density as a variable that captures how spatial form structures people and things in space, rather than the density on each plot or block, a measure of accessible FSI and GSI is used.

18. The distance threshold used in this paper is 500 metres because this is a distance that most people are willing to walk (Gehl, 2010). ... we refer to this as the intensity of pedestrian flow3 for the count of pedestrians during a whole day and fluctuation of pedestrian flow when discussing hourly changes.
19. Summarising the above, angular betweenness centrality is used as a measure of distance that describes space as part of movement routes. [[FSI]] and [[GSI]] are used as measures of [[density]], which describes space that can act as a destination. It thus induces movement, but also generates movement due to its concentration of people and things. These will be used as input variables to generate types, which will then be related to intensity and fluctuation of pedestrian flow.
20. Angular betweenness centrality is calculated for the non-motorised street network of each city.6 This includes all streets and paths that are accessible for people walking, including those shared with vehicles and bicycles. ....the radii included for analysis are close to the more local scales of pedestrian movement with a maximum of 5 kilometres.
21. Angular betweenness centrality (B) is calculated using the following equation:
22. ![](file:///C:/Users/Omar/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png)
23. where s and t are indices of the nodes in the network different from node x, rst is the number of geodesics linking s and t and rst(x) is the number of geodesics linking s and t that contain x.
24. For the accessible floor space index (AFSI), first the gross floor area (GFA) for each building polygon is calculated by multiplying the average building height9 by the built area (BA). Next, the accessible GFA and accessible BA are calculated using the equation for attraction reach (AR), as implemented in PST
25. ![](file:///C:/Users/Omar/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.png)
26. where o is the point of origin, a is an attraction (in this paper, attraction is a building polygon), D is the distance threshold (in this paper, set to 500 metres), A(o;D) is the set of reachable attractions given o and D, T is the type of measurement of interest (related to attraction); or 1 if no type of measurement is defined (in this paper, the type of measurement is GFA and BA, respectively), and f(a;T) is the attraction value, given T, associated with attraction a.

28. Accessible floor space index (AFSI) and accessible ground space index (AGSI) are then calculated as follows
29. ![](file:///C:/Users/Omar/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.png)
30. where Area(o;D) is the area of the convex hull, defined by the end-points of all reachable lines within the distance threshold D (500 metres) of the origin (o).10 The pedestrian survey included 20 neighbourhoods per city and was done over a three-week period in October 2017.16 The areas were selected with the main objective of covering all building and street types.

32. The data were organised by street segment and hour to produce the two variables for testing the performance of the urban types: the total intensity of pedestrian flow for a full day and the fluctuation of pedestrian flow from hour to hour. The clustering of street centrality resulted in four street types with different profiles or, to use the terms of Peponis et al. (2015), differentiation of scale (Figure 1).
33. The ‘Background streets’ (Scl1) represent the majority of street segments with low angular betweenness values at all scales; in other words, these streets do not play a significant syntactical role on any scale in the urban structure.
34. The ‘City streets’ (Scl3) include street segments with increasing angular betweenness centrality at higher scales and thus a more important role in through movement at the 5 kilometre scale.
35. Page 7
36. The third type, ‘Neighbourhood streets’ (Scl2), represents street segments with consistently high betweenness on most scales,
37. The fourth type, ‘Local streets’ (Scl4), includes street segments with high betweenness only on the very local scale, but dropping centrality on all others.
38. Compared to the other street types, both Neighbourhood and City streets (Scl2 and Scl3) have higher betweenness centrality values on all scales, giving them (according to the writings of Hillier et al., 1993), potential for higher-intensity pedestrian flow.The clustering of density resulted in seven building types. Six of these are similar to the earlier findings in Berghauser Pont and Haupt (2010) while a seventh, clearly distinct cluster, This seventh cluster is only found in London A predominance of very tall, podium-structure buildings, results here in very high FSI values.
39. The first cluster, ‘Spacious low-rise’ (Bcl1) combines low accessible FSI and low accessible GSI values and is dominated by villas or other freestanding buildings.
40. The second type, ‘Compact low-rise’ (Bcl2), has medium GSI and FSI values and represents areas dominated by terraced houses.
41. The third low-rise type, ‘Dense low-rise’ (Bcl4), has the highest FSI and GSI values of the three.
42. The next three building types have a higher average building height and thus higher FSI values, with the ‘Spacious mid-rise’ type (Bcl6), having the lowest GSI values of the three.
43. We find such things as point and slab buildings (typical of the modern era) but also perimeter blocks with large inner courts. The ‘Compact mid-rise’ type (Bcl5) has slightly higher FSI and GSI values,
44. followed by the ‘Dense mid-rise’ type (Bcl3) with the highest combination of FSI and GSI.
45. Page 8
46. The seventh cluster, ‘Compact high-rise’ (Bcl7), has the highest FSI values due to the building heights which are, on average, higher than in any of the other types.

48. The most important result of this paper is the distinct difference in performance between the generated urban types regarding pedestrian flow.
49. We identified weak, but significant correlations in all three cities when including the street and building types separately, but substantial correlations when combining street and building types.
50. We have shown, first, that building types explain the intensity of pedestrian flow, while street types explain the distribution of this intensity within the areas. Second, high GSI is as important to the number of pedestrians as high FSI.
51. Third, building types may explain the fluctuations in pedestrian flow during the day, which is something that the street types were unable to do.
52. For planning and design practice, these results may prove highly significant, as they highlight some strategic design choices. First, they allow designers to think in terms of street types which have a syntactical meaning, such as the supergrid and nested local streets.
53. Second, it provides insights into the importance of the relationship between street and building types in designing areas with different qualities, whether aiming for urban buzz or quiet residential areas.
