Abstract. The diversity and complexity of human settlements is reflected in the range of ways we try to understand them. The richness of subject matter presented by cities has given rise to an equal richness in methods of investigation. Even within a single field such as urban morphology, there are different approaches with different terms of reference. The challenge raised by the diversity is not how to select between the different views but how to combine and co-ordinate them. The purpose of this paper is to undertake an initial critical analysis of different approaches to urban morphology in an effort to meet that challenge. The first aim is to identify the range of different phenomena taken as the object of urban morphological enquiry. The second is to identify an aspect that is common to all the approaches and that can be used as a reference key to co-ordinate different views in a rigorous way. The ultimate goal is a composite view in which the different approaches support each other to provide a better understanding of human settlements.

·         Villages, towns and cities present a density and richness of subjects that is hard to find in any other human product. That richness is evident not only in the wide diversity of settlements and the depth of their complexity but also in terms of our capacity to identify and select different aspects to explain.

·         if we acknowledge that human settlements are diverse and multi-faceted, we should not be seduced by the superficial attractions of a single point of view.

·         This is particularly true of the morphological approach which, as originally conceived by Goethe, should be an independent study that makes use of the findings of all the other sciences, co-ordinating them under the unifying aspect of form (Wilkinson, 1962, pp. 177-8).

·         Page 3

·         There is the disparity between the fact that cities are the result of deliberate and coordinated human effort on the one hand and exhibit characteristics of ‘self-organization’ and emergent behaviour on the other.

·         What is the relation between local processes and global structure?

·         By what means should we seek to co-ordinate the different views and approaches?

·         Theories of evolution developed out of  lengthy, progressive efforts of classification and the perception of relationships between the species classified.

·         The elaboration of the theories has also fed back to ideas about classification, which have been refined in turn.

·         The wider state of affairs reflected in these questions is represented as a kind of microcosm within the field of urban morphology.

·         The purpose of this paper is to explore these issues through a critical analysis of a few core concepts used in the various approaches to urban morphology.

·         The aim is to find a specific means of co-ordinating the findings of the different approaches and help them work together and realize the significant potential to establish a richer multiple description.

·         Methodology

·         Page 4

·         For effective comparison, it is necessary to establish a consistent method of analysis using the same set of terms for all examples.

·         The primary criterion for evaluation is consistency: all instances of a given definition should be based on the same pertinent characteristics. Secondary criteria include specificity – definitions should clearly posit classes of identifiable phenomena in sufficient detail; generality – definitions should be based on pertinent characteristics found in as wide a variety of examples as possible while still allowing for the identification of specific differences; comprehension – definitions should account for as wide a range of objects as is appropriate to the task of explanation; coherence – definitions should be related to each other in a consistent way in order to form a clear structure.

·         Urban morphology

·         The obvious and perhaps superficially belaboured starting point for critical analysis must be the terms urban morphology and urban form.

·         the work of urban morphologists clearly suggests that the term is taken to refer more broadly to human settlements.

·         Morphology, as originally conceived by Goethe (1952) (see also Wilkinson, 1962) is the study of physical form, principally of living things but also works of art.

·         Page 5

·         School urban morphology: the persistence of Burgess and Hoyt

·         (for example, the General Certificate of Secondary Education in the UK), urban morphology is defined as ‘the pattern of land use within a town’ (an example in book form is Helm and Robinson, 2002).

·         To go beyond the superficial interpretation of ‘land use’ in this instance, it should be remembered that Burgess was a sociologist and referred to his own work as an ecological approach.

·         The pragmatic insights of Kevin Lynch

·         He explicitly defines settlement form as:

·         the spatial arrangement of persons doing things, the resulting spatial flows of persons, goods and information, and the physical features which modify space in some way significantto those actions,including enclosures, surfaces, channels, ambiences and objects. Further, the descriptions must include the cyclical and secular changes in those spatial distributions, the control of space, and the perception of it (p. 48).

·         Page 6

·         ‘Persons doing things’ and ‘flows of persons’ refer to the class of humans and the property of being engaged in some activity, including movement, and imply the relationship with the object or space that accommodates the activity.

·         The ‘control of space’ and the ‘perception of space’ are two different types of relation between a human (or group) and a space (and, by implication, part or all of the objects that define the space). A space or object is controlled by someone or some group and, equally, perceived by someone or some group.

·         The concepts of control and perception make no sense without both sides of the relation.

·         Compressed within Lynch’s concise definition of urban form are six distinct aspects:

·         • physical form

·         • use/activities/movement

·         • control

·         • perception

·         • continuity/change

·         • movement or flow of materials and information

·         For the purpose of determining more explicitly which aspects are included, four broad approaches to urban morphology can be identified, each taking a slightly different view of form:

·         • spatial analytical

·         • configurational

·         • process typological

·         • historico-geographical

·         The spatial analytical approach

·         Using a range of methods and models including GIS, cellular automata, agent based models and fractals, Batty seeks to understand the spatial structure and dynamics of cities as complex, emergent phenomena, in which global structure develops from local processes.

·         Page 8

·         The configurational approach

·         Space syntax represents the configurational approach to urban morphology, which seeks to understand the spatial structure of settlements through a range of analytical methods.

·         Like Batty, Hillier sees configuration as emergent, with global structure arising out of local processes.

·         For Hillier, ‘spatial form’ is the arrangement of spaces, with explicit reference to the position of any given space within the structure of the configuration as a whole. This formulation necessarily implies or assumes the ‘solid’ that defines the space or void.

·         The approach therefore implicitly includes the relation between humans and physical form. In terms of the aspects set out above, space syntax includes:

·         • space/physical form

·         • use/occupation/movement

·         • perception

·         The process typological approach

·         The approach they developed seeks to inform their architectural and urban proposals with an understanding of the built environment by examining its detailed structure and the historical process of its formation.

·         The analysis of copresence proceeds from an abstract set or schema of component subdivisions that forms a hierarchy: elements, structures of elements, systems of structures, and organisms of systems.

·         Page 9

·         The structure of elements is an association of buildings or an urban tissue, in general referred to as an aggregate (Figure 4).

·         The forms found at the different levels are identified as types which are conceived as cultural entities rooted in, and specific to, the local process of cultural development.

·         Function is therefore implicit in the type concept in that any form will have been initially conceived and developed to satisfy a particular human need or desire.

·         The idea of the building and the act of construction or modification are thus essential parts of the cultural process and are distinct in terms of classes, relations and properties.

·         Caniggia and Maffei thus identify the following distinct aspects of urban form:

·         • physical form

·         • function/use

·         • the idea of the building or form

·         • the act of construction/modification

·         • the cultural process of derivation and/or development/change

·         The historico-geographical approach

·         The historico-geographical approach to urban morphology is rooted in and well summarized by the work of the geographer M. R. G. Conzen.

·         Page 10

·         ... analysis is to explain the geographical structure and character of towns through a systematic analysis of their constituent elements and development through time. As set out in his seminal study of Alnwick (1969, pp. 3-5), he begins by distinguishing five general aspects:

·         • site

·         • function

·         • townscape

·         • social and economic context

·         • development

·         Within the townscape, he distinguishes three form complexes:

·         • town plan

·         • land utilization pattern

·         • building fabric

·         The town plan is itself subdivided into three complexes of plan-elements:

·         • street system

·         • plot pattern

·         • building pattern

·         Looking at the five general aspects in terms of classes, relations and properties, function and social and economic context are both based on the relations of ‘use’ or ‘activities’ between humans and built form.

·         Page 11

·         The social and economic context is the combination and interaction of different activities and functions over a wider area.

·         Site is defined principally in terms of the spatial relations and distribution of natural physical features such as geology, topography, hydrology and vegetation.

·         Page 12

·         In common use, the plot refers to a unit of property.

·         While the physical boundaries of plots generally correspond to the boundaries of control, it is not always the case (Kropf, 1997).

·         The case for physical form as the reference aspect

·         The results of the analysis are presented in Table 1, which groups the different aspects by general class and relationship, the four broad groups being spatial relation of physical objects, interrelations between humans and physical form, flows of resources and temporal relations.

·         Page 13

·         Table 1. General aspects of urban form as identified in the various approaches to urban

·          

·         It is to identify which amongst the commonly identifiedaspects provides the best reference key or registration mark for co-ordinating the other aspects so that different descriptions can be correlated in a rigorous way.

·         Page 14

·         Pertinent features of physical form

·         Focusing on physical form as a reference aspect out of a range of co-dependent aspects of urban form is not as simple as it might appear.

·         The different approaches to the study of form tend to abstract different features of physical form as pertinent to their investigations and represent them in different ways. At a general level, features and

·         relations include the following:

·         Features

·         • line (net)

·         • area/patch

·         • space

·         • module (solid/void)

·         Relations between features

·         • network

·         • patchwork aggregate cluster cellular matrix (aggregate of uniform defined planes) fractal

·         • hierarchy

·         • palimpsest

·         To an extent, the different approaches can be characterized by the features they take as pertinent and the relations between them:

·         • spatial analytical (patch, aggregate cluster, matrix)

·         • configurational (line, space, network)

·         • process typologogical (module, modular hierarchy)

·         • historico-geographical (area or patch, patch hierarchy, palimpsest)

·         Page 15

·         Identifying common features to use as the registration mark should not be a major intellectual feat.

·         If the different aspects of urban form and the different features of physical form are seen as different colours, each with its own pattern applied to a separate plate, it is the registration marks applied to each plate that make it possible to co-ordinate the printing of all the plates and generate a coherent image

·         The analogy is plausible in the first place because virtually all of the approaches to urban morphology make use of two-dimensional graphic representations of urban form, typically using the conventions of ortho graphic projection in plan.

·         Conclusion

·         The result highlights that there are at least four broad types of aspect and eleven logically distinct general aspects:

·         • spatial relations of physical features natural physical form built physical form

·         • interrelations between humans and physical features

·         - social and economic context

·         - use/function/activity

·         - control

·         - intention

·         - construction

·         - perception

·         • flows

·         - natural

·         - human

·         • change

·         - formation/transformation/cyclical change

·         Page 16

·         Identifying consistently defined aspects of form only clears the ground for and facilitates looking in more detail at the individual aspects, comparing them and investigating their interrelationships, associations and correspondences in order to identify the part they play in the processes of formation and transformation of urban form.

·         One starting point would be to confront the ambiguity that dogs particular features such as the plot and find their place in the overall structure of elements.

·         Another starting point would be to fully acknowledge the different types of overall structure that can be identified depending on the base elements chosen as pertinent.

·         Using physical form as a common reference aspect to co-ordinate different descriptions of urban form would be a significant step toward building a more coherent understanding of human settlements. The alternatives would seem to be either viewing human settlements as indivisible wholes or discrete and irreconcilable parts.
