```ad-abstract
Urban transportation is one of the most important target sectors for creating more sustainable and livable cities. Many US cities are making huge investments in public transit infrastructure in efforts to lower automobile use, encourage compact development, and curb greenhouse gas emissions. This paper explores how differences in the urban environment impact walking and transit use and how urban residents utilize walking and transit as modes of transportation. I use data from neighborhood mapping, observations, surveys, and interviews to explore these two questions. I find that walking is indeed the main mode of transportation within the urban core of Seattle. In contrast to what mainstream urban planning literature would suggest, residents living in the dense urban core of Seattle do not appear to be transit dependent and continue to drive at higher than expected rates. To help explain this, I explore how the ‘theory of urban fabrics’ applies to walkability and transit planning. This new emerging theory encourages planners to rediscover how to prioritize different modes of transportation within different parts of the city instead of current trends, which advocate for multimodal and shared streets throughout the city. Evidence indicates that the most walkable neighborhoods are those that have the least number of conflicts between pedestrians, transit, and automobiles, and that the transit system in Seattle suffers because it is not prioritized over cars in any significant way. This reduces the likelihood that individuals will make the switch to transit over driving, which has important implications for transportation planning policies.

## Bullet points
1. [[transit|Urban transportation]] is one of the most important target sectors for creating more sustainable and livable cities.
2. This paper explores how differences in the urban environment impact walking and [[transit]] use and how urban residents utilize walking and transit as modes of transportation. I use data from [[neighborhood]] mapping, observations, surveys, and interviews to explore these two questions.
3. Many cities are presently pursuing the development of multi-modal transit systems, constructing and expanding light rail transit, expanding bus service and experimenting with bus rapid transit, and modern streetcars.
4. Urban planners have promoted compact and walkable urban forms and new models of land use and transportation since the early 1990s. There is mounting evidence to suggest that a majority of the general public would prefer living in walkable urban environments where driving is not a necessity (National Association of Realtors 2013). This is related to the phenomenon of “peak car” (Newman and Kenworthy 2015; Metz 2013), which has seen the decrease over the past decade in per capita driving due in part to technological innovations and shifts in cultural preferences.
5. In this paper, I explore two related questions: 1) how do residents in compact urban neighborhoods utilize walking and public transit in their daily lives, and 2) how do variations in compact urban environments influence walking behavior. Both questions relate to the concerns raised above regarding how to best invest in public transit and how to create walkable urban environments that are safe and inviting.
6. Walkability planning and public transportation planning would greatly benefit from adopting the [[theory of urban fabrics]]. This theory seeks to reestablish within each urban fabric its primary mode of transportation –walking within the pedestrian fabric, transit use within the transit fabric, and cars within the automobile fabric. Current transit planning suffers from its often-singular objective of getting people out of cars and reducing GHG emissions, and as a result, new transit proposals extend slow and inefficient bus and rail networks into far-flung suburbs where increased ridership is unlikely to meet expectations.
7. Urban planning studies often refer to the 5Ds of compact development, which include
	1.  **density** (of population and/or jobs), 
	2. **diversity** (of land use mix within a given area),
	3. **design** (of the street network and its level of connectedness),
	4. **destination accessibility**, and 
	5. **distance to transit** (Ewing 1997; Ewing and Cervero 2010; Campoli 2012; Stevens 2017; Cervero and Kockelman 1997).
8. Urban design research on walkability incorporates other physical as well as non-physical elements. This includes physical elements such as the presence of street trees, public seating, well-designed and accessible crosswalks, and other elements found specifically in the street right-of-way where walking takes place. It also includes harder to define elements, such as the aesthetic qualities of streets, sense of safety, and ambiance. Additionally, evidence supports the fact that personal characteristics, individual behaviors, social contexts, cultural values, and various policies also affect the walkability of a place, and that walkability varies from person to person even in the same place (Forsyth 2015). Walkability is a complex phenomenon that researchers approach in many different ways depending on their background and their purpose.
9. This project uses a mixed methods research design using the urban core of Seattle and the Seattle region as the case study. The findings are based on data collected from neighborhood mapping and observations of walking and transit use activity, a travel and walkability survey, and interviews. The urban core was chosen as the primary study area due to its level of compactness. The urban core is comprised of several distinct neighborhoods but are all similar in density, street connectivity, and have a mix of land uses. Figure 2 shows the urban core study area and its Walk Score, which serves as a proxy of walkability and urban form. Figure 3 shows the land use mix of the study area.
10. Neighborhood mapping was conducted in June and July 2016 and is based on King County Assessor data, City of Seattle land use and zoning maps, and visual observations of the street environments. A total of 110 blocks within the urban core of Seattle were chosen for observation of pedestrian and transit use behavior (figure 4). Weekday observations of pedestrian activity and transit use were conducted in September and October 2016. For each block, pedestrians and transit user counts were taken in five-minute intervals, on three separate days in the morning, afternoon, and evening. The travel and walkability survey was conducted online with residents throughout Seattle. The survey was comprised of 58 questions consisting of multiple choice and Likert scale questions as well as open-ended responses. The survey was open from August to November 2016. A total of 249 complete surveys were collected.
11. The survey was advertised with flyers given to pedestrians and transit users, left on cars, sent by email, and posted on social media. It was advertised as a walkability and travel survey, so there is likely to be a degree of self-selection in participation as individuals who care about these issues are more likely to complete the survey, possibly skewing the results.
12. The theory of urban fabrics has many implications for current planning practice, and the findings presented here begin to show evidence that a new approach to walkability and transportation planning is needed, and that the theory of urban fabrics can provide that framework. The theory of urban fabrics argues that each of the separate urban fabrics making up a city –pedestrian, transit, and automobile –prioritize these modes through their land use patterns and types of infrastructures.
13. For much of the twentieth century, urban planners and engineers struggled with how to best accommodate the automobile into the urban fabric of the city, often tearing down buildings to widen streets, or demolishing entire neighborhoods to construct highways. These elements eroded the pedestrian and transit fabrics that made pre-automobile cities walkable and transit friendly.
14. In order to better prioritize pedestrians in this part of the city, planners should seek ways to widen [[sidewalks]] on several key arterials that are direct routes through neighborhoods. Currently many of these arterials have narrow sidewalks and no buffers between pedestrians and moving traffic (i.e. trees or parked cars). Adding such buffers would greatly benefit pedestrians, while also slowing traffic and making the roads safer for car traffic. Providing safer crossings at heavily trafficked intersections is another way to prioritize pedestrians in this fabric.
15. The [[theory of urban fabrics]] provides planners a framework by which prioritizing different modes of transportation in different parts of the city –pedestrians in the pedestrian fabric, transit in the transit fabric, and cars in the automobile fabric.
