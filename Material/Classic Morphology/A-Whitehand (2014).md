## Abstract
```ad-abstract
The concepts ‘typological process’ and ‘morphological period’ have received surprisingly little empirical substantiation despite their familiarity to many urban morphologists. They are examined here in two contrasting cultural areas—England and the Shanghai area, China—over the period from the mid-19th century to the late-20th century. Sequences of ordinary residential building types are recognized in the two areas: for example, historical series of terraced house types in England and historical variations on the lilong development unit in the Shanghai area. Periods characterized by different types and connections between those types are identified. The areas are different in both their building types and their periodizations but commonalities in their processes of change, including those related to the spread of Western fashions, are found. The difficulty of uncovering the mechanism of the typological process whereby one form type is succeeded by another reflects major problems of assembling the requisite data. Many more comparative studies, including between contrasting cultural areas, are needed.

## Bullet points
1. In terms of scale, such study ranges from examination of individual plots and buildings, or even parts of plots and buildings, to the configuration of entire urban areas, or even constellations of urban areas.
2. More than a few of these studies have drawn to varying degrees on the concepts of either the ‘typological process’ or the ‘morphological period’, though rarely the two in combination.
3. Studies of changes to urban form have been based on various kinds of records of the state of the urban landscape at different times. The sources of information that allow comparisons over time to be made include maps and plans, photographs, archaeological excavations, and verbal descriptions, though for most of the world only the latter two are available for much before the industrial era.
4. One of the striking features to emerge from such work is that changes to the urban landscape, like many other types of change, tend to occur at a very uneven pace. For example, housebuilding has fluctuated greatly over time (Gottlieb, 1976) and related to the fluctuations the physical make-up of cities has varied considerably (Whitehand, 1987). 
5. It has long been recognized in Western countries that change takes place within a series of ‘morphological periods’: architectural historians speak rather more narrowly of ‘architectural periods’ and Italian architects, notably of the Caniggian school, recognize ‘phases’ (Caniggia and Maffei, 2001, pages 55–56).
6. Each morphological period is characterized by the widespread introduction of new forms: for example, new types of street layout, building types, and architectural styles.
	1. At the end of one morphological period and the beginning of the next both old and new forms tend to be created, and there is a tendency for the change from old to new to be associated with socioeconomic instability…
	2. Geographical urban morphologists have mapped the physical manifestations of these morphological periods (Conzen, 1958). Architects of the Caniggian school have discussed at length, and speculated about, the manner in which the change takes place from one predominant physical form to another (Caniggia and Maffei, 2001, pages 50–55; Corsini, 1997; Petruccioli, 2007, pages 38–47).
	3. These two perspectives on this important aspect of change deserve greater consideration—notably in respect of their relationship with one another.
		1. One aspect that particularly merits more attention is the way in which and the extent to which the features that characterize a new morphological period are latent or beginning to emerge in the preceding period.
7. In pursuing this topic it is helpful to make a distinction between two kinds of urban landscape change.
	1. One is the adaptation (in a broad sense) of existing forms: this includes, for example, the modification of a building, perhaps by adding rooms or changing the roof, or, in the case of a street, it might involve changing the relationship between the areas allocated to vehicles and those for pedestrian use only.
		1. Changes of this type may occur at various intervals over the lifespan of a plot, building, street, or other feature in the landscape.
	2. The other kind of change is the introduction of new types of buildings, streets, or other features.
8. The distinction between these two kinds of landscape change has been widely recognized by architects of the Caniggian school. They have gone further and postulated that the second is a product of the first: that existing forms and adaptations of those forms are a seedbed for new types.
	1. Thus adaptations of existing buildings, for example, are seen as the basis for new types of building. The manifestation on the ground of large numbers of a new type frequently has to await a major socioeconomic happening—in extreme cases a social revolution.
	2. It is this sequence whereby types that predominate in a new period of urban development are conceived out of the predominant type or types in an earlier period, or diffused from areas in which new types have already become established, that is frequently referred to by architects of the Caniggian school as a ‘typological process’ (processo tipologico) (Caniggia and Maffei, 2001, pages 54–55).

9. In practice, most research directly on the typological process, even that relating to periods for which the necessary data are available, has been impressionistic.
	1. Furthermore, studies of related topics (for example, [[morphological periods]]) have been more concerned with the spatial manifestation of types on the ground than with the origin of those types.
10. However, if the process of morphological change is to be fully understood more needs to be known about how types arise.
	1. Rather than focusing on the mature types (for example, mature building types) that have come to be recognized as characteristic of particular morphological periods, more attention needs to be given to the change from one type to another.
11. In making this change of focus from the morphological period to the changes that are the prelude to such a period, obtaining the requisite data is a prime consideration.
12. Considering the evidence from these two contrasting areas, what can be distilled about the typological process and the morphological period? First, differences between buildings constructed at different times can be recognized in broad terms.
13. Conclusion, use this to describe the
	1. [[Morphological periods]], in contrast, are much more readily accessible to empirical study, being based on a comparison between what is dominant within them and what had been dominant in the preceding period.
	2. … there is a major difference between our ability on the one hand to recognize different types and on the other to grasp the process by which one type is succeeded by another. The search for the latter entails speculations that generally go beyond the limits of the available data.

14. Empirical substantiation, in the sense of demonstrating direct causality, is impeded in most areas by the limited quantities of the requisite data and the sheer practical difficulties of assembling those data where they exist. That there is generally a recognizable developmental sequence from one morphological period to the next is evident in our study areas.
15. Morphological periods, in contrast, are much more readily accessible to empirical study, being based on a comparison between what is dominant within them and what had been dominant in the preceding period. Some of the differences between morphological periods are clearer cut than others.
