```ad-abstract
This book has taken shape over many years, as part of an ongoing consideration of the way in which society and urban form interact over time. My research focus on the suburbs was first sparked by Professor Bill Hillier, who liked to tease me, as his student on the Bartlett’s MSc Advanced Architectural Studies, as being ‘just a girl from Edgware’ (despite my having spent much of my life till then in the suburbs of Jerusalem). This very much echoes the experience of my predecessor at the Bartlett, Ian Davis, almost exactly forty years earlier. In ‘Dunroamin’, Davis describes his own first day at the Bartlett School of Architecture in 1953, putting down ‘Edgware’ as his address and being advised by his tutor that he should make rapid plans to move from there to a more ‘civilised address, such as Camden Town’.1 Subsequently, my reading of Mark Clapson’s essential histories of the working-class suburb opened my eyes up to alternative narratives of the twentieth-century suburban experience. I should also mention the series of exchanges with Vesna Goldsworthy, whose ‘The Good Life’ conference at Kingston University in 2004 formalised suburban studies as a field of academic research in its own right. Shortly after the conference Vesna and I wrote a proposal for a multidisciplinary book on suburban studies, which, although never realised, helped seed the idea for this book in its current guise.

The urban theories of Bill Hillier, Julienne Hanson and Alan Penn at the UCL Space Syntax Laboratory, Bartlett School of Architecture, have deeply influenced my thinking about how cities grow and change. Amongst many of my other colleagues elsewhere at UCL I would like to particularly mention the work on high streets by Matthew Carmona of the Bartlett School of Planning. Last, but not least, I would like to mention the vital contribution that my research colleagues Muki Haklay and Sam Griffiths have made to the creation of this book. Our weekly discussions over coffee and cake influenced my own reflections of the suburbs as being as complex as the city itself. Essential to this understanding was Muki’s thinking regarding interdisciplinary research and the nature of space in geography, as well as Sam’s urban historian’s conception of the temporality of urban form.

2. Even when they are studied, suburbs tend to be considered separately from the city or as an undefined mass within a chaotic peri-urban landscape at the city edges (Vaughan et al. 2010a). rather than taking the city out of the suburb or the suburb out of the city, the intention of Suburban Urbanities is to consider the two together: the suburb as a continuum of the city’s spatial–social complexity. It is therefore intended to make the case for the suburbs’ (however defined) urbanity.

4. In considering suburbs as a continuum of the city, this book focuses on metropolitan suburban centres: both in their relation to other centres elsewhere in the city, and in the role they play in relation to their locality.

6. When considered in fields such as cultural geography or literary studies, the study of suburbia has determinedly focused on the suburb as the place of the ‘other’, the ‘wild’ or the wilderness (Wunsch 1995). In spite of (or perhaps because of) the fact that the majority of people in English-speaking countries live in it, suburbia has remained ‘the love that dares not speak its name’ (Goldsworthy 2004): it is all too frequently despised and easily patronised. Critics maintain that suburbs lead to alienation, that they are homogenous breeding grounds for apathy, yet suburbia is nonetheless the place many people aspire to live.

8. The term suburb is trapped by an historical legacy of aesthetic distaste from the cultural elite, such as the declaration of the International Congress of Modern Architecture in 1933 that the suburb is ‘a kind of scum churning against the walls of the city’ and that it is ‘one of the greatest evils of the century’ (cited in Oliver et al. 1981). In planning studies the focus is on the suburb’s spatial position in relation to the centre and the notion that suburban centres are simply an extension of the city is the orthodoxy in most treatments of the subject (Bourne 1996). One criticism of this approach is that centre–periphery models only make sense at an observer-agreed scale of what constitutes a region. Instead, it could be argued that spatial relationships repeat and overlap at many different scales and are not inherently stable. This book will show that urban growth that follows the spatial logic of the existing network is a pattern that has worked well for centuries. Indeed, suburban growth has been a positive solution for inner-city crowding, albeit reinforcing social class divisions in some instances.

10. As Nick Barratt shows in his Greater London: the story of the suburbs, by the eighteenth century ‘it became increasingly possible … to commute daily from nearby suburbs or to commute weekly from ones further away’ (Barratt 2013: 105). The subsequent development of the railways in the nine teenth century and the twentieth-century growth of private motor car ownership (and the subsidy of road building by governments in the USA) had equally important impact both spatially and socially.1

12. Multi-scale pathways and adaptation to change are at the heart of much of the research described here. Many of the empirical chapters use space syntax theories and methods that, due to their ability to analyse spatial systems at multiple scales and in relation to socio-economic factors, allow for this complex issue to be addressed. The theory and methods of space syntax, integrated with those of urban anthropology, are a useful combination for studying the dynamic processes described in this book. Over the past three decades space syntax research has developed mathematical (latterly computerised) urban models to help assess patterns of land use and economic viability in relation to urban form (Hillier 1996).This book’s theoretical position has been shaped by ideas developed on two research projects at University College London (UCL), both of which took a cross-disciplinary approach to bring methods from architecture, anthropology, history and geography to inform research into London’s suburban evolution since the nineteenth century. Cities are routinely acknowledged as complex and dynamic built environments but this description is rarely extended to the suburbs, which are generally regarded as epiphenomena of the urbs and therefore of little intrinsic theoretical interest in themselves.
