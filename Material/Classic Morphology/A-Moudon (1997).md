```ad-abstract
The forces and events leading to the formation of the International Seminar on Urban Form (ISUF) are identified. ISUF is expanding the field of urban morphology beyond its original confines in geography, particularly into the domains of architecture and planning. Three schools of urban morphology, in England, Italy and France, are coming together, following seminal work by two morphologists, M.R.G. Conzen and Saverio Muratori. The bringing together of these schools provides the basis for an interdisciplinary field and the opportunity to establish common theoretical foundations for the growing number of urban morphologists in many parts of the world. ISUF’s ambitious mission is to address real and timely issues concerning city building by providing a forum for thought and action which includes related disciplines and professions in different cultures. The potential of an interdisciplinary urban morphology to contribute to the understanding and management of urban development in a period of unprecedented change is discussed.

11. The ISUF meetings confirmed that several generations of scholars had been active in urban morphology, not only in England, but also in Italy and in France, and that many countries were contributing to the field.
12. Two individuals figure prominently as seminal instigators of the field: M.R.G. Conzen and Saverio Muratori. Both men were unusual and non-conforming in their respective realms of geography and architecture.
13. J.W.R. Whitehand (1981) ensured Conzen’s legacy by compiling some individual researchers from a variety of other
14. In Italy, Gianfranco Caniggia (1933-87) took over the mantle of Muratori who had supervised his 1963 study of the city of Como. In his teachings and publications, Caniggia continued the Muratorian tradition, which he called ‘procedural typology’ because of the focus on building types as the elemental root of urban form.

16. Like the Italian School, the French School rose out of a reaction against modernist architecture and its rejection of history.
17. The Conzenian group maintained a consistent profile in British and American geographical circles, benefiting internationally from the active participation of Conzen’s son, M.P. Conzen, a geographer at the University of Chicago,

20. In retrospect, however,the Italian contribution that was most instrumental in linking the three main schools of urban morphology, and hence in shaping ISUF, was the rehabilitation programme of Bologna’s historic centre - for which Caniggia was a consultant.

22. The theoretical basis
23. This coming together of researchers from different language areas and disciplines is founded on common ground.
24. First, there is agreement that the city or town can be ‘read’ and analysed via the medium of its physical form.
25. Further, there is widespread acknowledgment that, at its most elemental level, morphological analysis is based on three principles.
	1. Urban form is defined by three fundamental physical elements: buildings and their related open spaces, plots or lots, and streets.
	2. Urban form can be understood at different levels of resolution. Commonly, four are recognized, corresponding to the building/lot, the street/block, the city, and the region.
	3. Urban form can only be understood historically since the elements of which it is comprised undergo continuous transformation and replacement.
26. The smallest cell of the city is recognized as the combination of two elements: the individual parcel of land, together with its building or buildings and open spaces.
27. Over time, these elements are either used differently - for example, by different social classes - transformed physically, eliminated or replaced by new forms.
28. Building and transformation cycles are important processes to explore for city planning and real estate development purposes, yet are rarely studied in contemporary cities.

30. The three schools each have had different intentions in their theory building efforts.
	1. The study of urban form for descriptive and explanatory purposes, with the aim of developing a theory of city building (théorie de l’édification de la ville).
		1. This is the primary purpose of geographers,and the Birmingham School in particular. Social scientists in the French School
	2. The study of urban form for prescriptive purposes, with the aim of developing a theory of city design. This is the primary focus of the Italian School
	3. The study of urban form to assess the impact of past design theories on city building.
31. This is in the realm of design criticism, which makes the sophisticated distinction between the theory of design ‘as idea’, and the theory of design ‘as practised’.
32. The French School has championed this use of morphological analysis, tracing successfully the roots of modernism in urban design back to the eighteenth century.

34. Most urban morphological research has focused on historic European cities, a double limitation which may seem to hinder practical applications in today’s world.
35. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can now not only record the spatial characteristics of habitats, but also link spatial attributes to quantitative data so that, for the first time, physical space can be measured and analysed in relation to the socio-economic forces that shape it - for example, census data can now be linked fairly easily to actual building forms and land uses.
36. Page 9
37. Significantly, parcel-based GIS offer the empirical data that urban morphologists need (and have so far painstakingly acquired by hand).Collected longitudinally, such empirical data open up immense research opportunities to both monitor and explain the transformation of urban forms. Expectations must  necessarily be guarded -technology having proved to be an excellent servant, but a poor master. However, current advances in parcel-based GIS can help to move the centre of urban morphological research from its foundation in the study of small historic towns to today's large urbanized regions, and from applications in urban conservation to the management of future urban development.
