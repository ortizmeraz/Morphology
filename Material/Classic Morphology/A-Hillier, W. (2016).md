## Abstract
```ad-abstract
**In this paper, we ask what cities are for, and how this relates to their [[spatial form]]**. This is an issue on which space syntax so far has said nothing. It is routine to say cities exist to create contact, but this seems at least overgeneralised, since cities are also often noted for their anonymity. Here we argue that **cities exist to create not contact in general, but two very specific kinds of contact,** and these relate to the dual form of what syntax has called the generic city – the idea that the urban grid is made up of two interlocking grids, each with its own metric and geometric properties: **a foreground grid structured by and serving microeconomics, and a background grid structured by sociocultural factors and serving mainly residence**, the two being linked by a pattern of pervasive centres. These different spatial structures generate fundamental differences in social networks which in the foreground grid serve the need for morphogenesis, and in the background grid, the need for stability. **The coexistence of microeconomic morphogenesis and sociocultural stability is what the city is for, and it is both reflected in and created by the dual form of the generic city.**

## Bullets
  - … how key concepts of social network theory fit into the spatial model of the city proposed by syntax….. The argument will focus on the concept of the generic city, and will mean looking at the origins of cities as well as their future.
- [[space syntax]] explains how cities work – how space, movement, land uses, human activity and psychology combine to create the complex forms we occupy and experience. But it does not explain what they work for,…
- To understand them, it is not enough – perhaps sometimes not even relevant – to know the reasons why particular cities were created. It’s what they become that matters. Cities are not designed things, but emergent processes.
- One of the most unexpected outcomes of the syntactic analysis of large numbers of cities is the discovery that spatially speaking, and at a deep enough level, cities seem to be the same kind of thing. This does not mean that cities are not individuals,… What it means is that underlying all these differences there is at a deep enough level a generic city, that is, a structure that makes a city a city in the first place (Hillier 2012, 2014).
- What syntax does is to define a key spatial dimension of the common structure and associate it broadly with different types of human action.
- **What then is the [[generic city]]**? (Hillier 2012, 2014)**. It is the idea that the street network that links the buildings that make up the city is a dual system** made up of **two inter-related sub-networks**, each with its own metric and geometric properties: - **a foreground network** made up of a small number of longer lines with route continuity; and - a **background network** made up of a much larger number of shorter lines, with more localised connections.
- The **[[foreground network]]**, through what I have called **the ‘city making process’, acquires the form of a pervasive network of** linked **centres** at all scales, and is **driven by microeconomic activity**,…
- The **[[background network]] is driven by a sociocultural residential process**, which typically seeks to diffuse and structure movement in the image of cultural **ideas expressed through residence**.
- This paper offers two fundamental propositions about the generic city, **one about the origin of the structure**, and **one about its functional effects and its future**, both areas where current theory is somewhat chaotic:
- that the appearance of the city was coterminous {adjacent} with the appearance of the dual form of the generic city – the implication being that **the generic city may have made the city possible**; **if** **there was a reason for**, or process of, **concentration of people,** then the generic city allowed it to happen, and very fast by structuring it.
- that **the generic city evolved as the dominant form for large and dense settlements**, and so dominated evolution because it both reflects and generates two very sp**ecific kinds of contact which are necessary to the success of large and dense concentrations of people** living in close proximity – and this is just as true today as it was then, and will perhaps be no less important in the future.
- **==Proposition 1: that the generic city dates from the first cities==**
- As Yoffee says, against this background, “cities appeared almost as supernovas, and society changed utterly” (Yoffee 2005, p. 214). But there is little agreed theory about why the supernovas happened, or how they transformed society. Most theories, in any case, see the city as a social, rather than spatial, system, and see the task of theory purely in social terms. (Adams 1966).

- The city becomes a placeless system of social roles and relations. In cases where there is spatial evidence, discussion of the physical and [[spatial form]] tends to be confined to the organic-geometric distinction, with the assumption that the former is, socially as well as spatially, bottom-up, the latter top-down.

- It would be safe to conclude that in these villages and small towns, there is little evidence of the potential of a generic spatial structure which could hold a much larger system together.

- It must remain **only a conjecture at this stage**, but there does seem a strong possibility that these **networks of canals formed part of the emergence of the dual grid, and so the ‘generic city’**. …. If this is the case, it would be a clear example of the common process of an emergent pattern becoming a recognised structure that can be used in design and planning.

- **==Proposition 2: why the generic city==**

- So how and why has the generic city dominated the evolution of cities, from their origins until now? … We might say they are characterised by informational morphogenesis. … Informational morphogenesis must in some sense be a function of the increase in human contact and information flow that cities bring about.


Having worked so many years with modern informal settelments, I need to digest this idea
           

- …the answer, I will propose, lies in the different ways the two parts of the generic city generate social networks.

- it will be useful to begin by reflecting on cities as knowledge systems, in comparison to pre-urban societies. … pre-urban societies, whether mobile or settled, need two kinds of knowledge. The first is practical knowledge of their material environment and where and how to get enough to eat for its members to survive biologically. … The second kind of knowledge we can call social knowledge comprises the social rules and categories which link the spatial group to others.

- ==Network analysis==

- Practical knowledge becomes a global economic system, not only within the city, but between cities, and assigns categories to individuals by virtue of their place in the global knowledge system – the division of labour. … At the same time, social knowledge in terms of purely social relations, becomes a local and short model as the old long model systems disappear as they no longer have their global role to play. This knowledge duality is of course reflected in the spatial duality of the city, with the foreground network playing its economic role and the background network the sociocultural.

- A key network variable in social network analysis, and one associated with some of its most powerful results, is clustering: that if _a_ knows _b,_ and _a_ knows _c_, then _b_ knows _c_. (Figure 6). The more this relation holds in a system then the more the system will be dense, meaning that a high proportion of possible relations are actual relations.

- Perhaps because clusteredness is so strongly associated with a positive and important social concept, there is no everyday positive term for the lack of clusteredness in a system. Burt, a key student of such systems, describes it in terms of the proportion of “structural holes” in the system, meaning the proportion of triads where a knows b and c, but b does not know c.

- The dense-sparse distinction (more precisely, clustered-unclustered) is spatially interesting because it allows us to picture social networks in a spatial way.

- Without too much fantasy, we might even use the spatial analogy to generate a picture of the whole network. To the degree that sparse spikes reaching out from the dense local groups were associated with particular groups of people, it would form something like a foreground network, linking the dense, more localised background networks.

- The dense-sparse distinction is also important for the research results it has delivered on social networks, including their spatial dimensions.

- Compared to pre-urban societies, then, **the city is a new kind of dual knowledge system**, with the microeconomic and the sociocultural essentially reversed. **Economic life is about the interaction of knowledge** groups **in the foreground network**,…. while **social life is** about the interaction of spatially located groups **in the background network**, and so more localised.

- Eagle et al. showed that those living in socioeconomically successful areas had networks that were less dense, with social advantage again clearly associated with sparse networks. At the same time, networks in successful areas were both socially and spatially more diverse, and those in less advantaged areas more concentrated socially and spatially (Eagle et al. 2010).

- We can clarify this theoretically by making an analogy between network structures and Shannon’s mathematical theory of information. Shannon distinguishes between the redundancy (or structure) of a language, and the information that it can transmit.

- The more the contacts are with the dense parts of the network, the more the information will refer to the existing structure of information, and so to the redundancy of the system, in Shannon’s terms.

- The foreground network, with its strong linear relations between local centres, and the highly explorable small scale local grids of those centres, reflects the two components of the Levy flight
