```ad-abstract
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the research field of urban morphology: the study of urban form. Urban morphology is a growing field of cross-disciplinary research, attracting worldwide interest among scholars in architecture, geography and planning. It aims to decipher the physical form, the urban landscape or townscape of complex contemporary cities. This paper discusses the evolution of urban morphology, from its conceptual foundations in research on the physical form of urban are as. Interestingly, the roots of urban morphology can be traced back to different disciplines in different countries. This discussion will cast light on various research perspectives of urban morphology, as well as discussing similarities and differences between the geographical and the architectural approaches to urban form studies. This is followed by a closer look at the theories developed by Gianfranco Caniggia and MRG Conzen. Their work has been an inspiration for many practitioners and researchers, including Whitehand, Maffei, and Moudon to name a few. Finally, a schematic diagram is presented, which reflects the heightened activity of research on physical form that is currently occurring in several disciplines simultaneously, and showing the relationships between research traditions and authors. As the formation and development of the urban landscape becomes ever more diverse, it is necessary to revisit and use the concepts and methods established by Caniggia and Conzen in the management of urban landscape changes.

2. [[-Concepts/urban morphology|Urban morphological]] researchers are concerned with the form and structure of an urban landscape.
3. The word ‘morphology’ was first used in bioscience to describe form and structure, but now is increasingly being used in geography, architecture, geology, philology and other disciplines.
4. The roots of urban morphology lie in geography in Britain and Germany, and architecture in Italy and France.
5. In fact, urban morphology can be viewed as part of a much wider movement that arose as a reaction against Modernism in architecture and urban planning during the period 1959 to 1961.
6. **The Geographical Perspective**
7. Page 4
8. MRG [[Conzen]] (1907–2000) was a student at the Geographical Institute of the University of Berlin from 1926. He was inspired by pioneers in the field of geography at that time, attending their seminars and field excursions. He was especially taken with the ideas of Schlüter and the work of Herbert Louis (1936).
9. In Italy there is a strong link between urban morphology and urban design, as urban morphology developed as a critique on modernist doctrines of architecture and planning. Architect Saverio [[Muratori]] (1910–1973) is the seminal figure in the development of systematic ways of investigating the evolution of the Italian City.
10. [[Muratori]] ... believed that urban planning and urban design .... theory systematically ceased to be cultural devices deeply rooted in the history of the place during the first half of the twentieth century.
11. ... urban analysis as a form of operative history, offering both an alternative to and criticism of the programmes and the methods of Modernist architecture and planning.
12. Page 6
13. Muratori’s rejection of the Modern movement before the popular rise of Post-Modernism led to criticisms that he was favouring the status quo instead of searching for new forms.
14. His teaching was aimed at understanding the various values inherent in the phases of urban formation, ranging from the influences on and implications of projects involving existing buildings in historic downtown areas,to projects concerned with the creation of suburbs.
15. Muratori was concerned that modern architecture was in crisis because architects were more focused on raising monuments rather than continuing the process of adding to the inherited form, as realised through history and so expressing the local culture.
16. Page 7
17. [[Cannigia]] (1997) advocated studying the steps involved in the creation and evolution of the built environment in order to understand an urban landscape. 
18. The French perspective s. As in Italy, the French school, based principally at the Versailles School of Architecture, was established as a rejection of the Modern movement ([[Moudon]] 1997).
19. The [[French school]] took a much broader perspective, aiming to understand the city in a multidisciplinary context (Moudon, 1994). A connection was soon established between the French and the Italian schools, however they differed in two important aspects of their approach to urban morphology – their approach to the dialectic of urban form and social action, and the dialectic of modern versus non modern.
20. Lefebvre introduced the concept of the right to the city in the book, Le Droit à la ville (Lefebvre 1968), after which he published several influential works on cities, urbanism, and space. The Production of Space (Lefebvre 1974) became one of the most influential and heavily cited works on urban theory.
21. Conzen’s study of Alnwick, Northumberland (first published in 1960; revised edition published in 1969) is the seminal work in the field of urban morphology in Britain. 
22. Page 8
23. Conzen ... Alnwick...Newcastle...inspired much of the English-language work on plan analysis in the second half of the twentieth century, and established a basic framework of principles for urban morphology.
24.  Conzen’s approach was historical and evolutionary in looking at the form of the town as the result of the sequence of events in its formation.
25. Conzen’s work generated an extended technical vocabulary, terminology and procedures for analysing the town plan, the aim being to explain the geographical character of towns, which he believed was determined by significant economic and social factors within the regional context.
26. According to Conzen, the townscape is a combination of a town plan, and patterns of building forms and urban land use (Conzen, 1960).
27. The town plan itself is subdivided into three constituent parts or elements (Figure 1):
	- (i) [[street]]s and their arrangement in a street system;
	- (ii) [[plots]] and their aggregation in street-blocks; and
	- (iii) [[building type|building]]s or, more precisely, their block-plans
	(Conzen, 1960, p. 5).
28. [[Street]]: a space (street-space) in a built-up area bounded by street-lines and reserved for the use of surface traffic. It is a plan element (Conzen, 1969, p.130).
29. [[Plot]]: a parcel of land representing a land-use unit defined by boundaries on the ground. It is a plan element (Conzen, 1969, p. 128).
30. Block-plan of a building: the area occupied by a building and defined on the ground by the lines of its containing walls. Loosely referred to as the ‘building’.
31. It is a plan element (Conzen, 1969, p. 123).
32. The urban plan-divisions arrange themselves in a hierarchy, with each successive order comprising a combination of divisions of the next lowest order (Conzen, 1969, p. 128). Morphogenetic regions are formed of a combination of the town plan, building fabric, land utilisation pattern and the site (Kropf, 1993, p. 38).
33. A morphological period represents any period in the history of an area that creates distinctive material forms in the urban landscape to suit the particular socio-economic needs of its society (Conzen, 1969, p. 127).
34. The Caniggian Approach
35. Gianfranco Caniggia, an assistant of Muratori, continued Muratori’s work on building types. Caniggia made his own contribution based on his research applying the interpretation method.
36. Caniggia divided buildings into residential and special buildings. The latter are buildings whose principal function is not as a dwelling – for example mosques, convents, or even palaces.
37. Page 10 
38. Caniggia argued against the methods used by modern architects.
39. In his view, the crisis in modern architecture arose out of a disparity between the products of building and the intentions of those using them.
40. If the common form is lost, the knowledge, experience and memories connected to it are not transmitted between generations. 
41. The aim of Gianfranco Caniggia’s theoretical approach is to understand the built form by examining the historical process of its formation.
42. The past is the key to the present and therefore by studying buildings, their rules of construction and development can be uncovered through systematic interpretation of the built form.
43. Architecture, as language, is a living form, through which people have achieved a sort of unwritten building codification by identifying history and structure (Kristjánsdóttir, 2005).
44. According to Caniggia, each society has unwritten rules on certain things (e.g., behaviour, language). Such rules are built on the common knowledge held by a society, which is based on its culture, and what is considered right or wrong – or what Caniggia and Maffei (2001, p. 43) refer to as spontaneous consciousness.
45. This concept is so well embedded within the society that when people refer to a house, they have the same picture in mind. 
46. Critical consciousness takes over when the a priori type vanishes and a new type can be formed (Caniggia & Maffei, 2001, pp. 45-7).
47. Caniggia and Maffei (2001) define type (typo) in the following way:
	1. During a moment of greater civil continuity, builders, guided by their spontaneous consciousness, can produce an object “without thinking twice”, only unconsciously conditioned by their cultural background. That object will be determined out of previous experiences in their civil surroundings, transformed into a system of integrated cognitions, assumed unitarily to satisfy the particular need to which that object has to correspond (Caniggia & Maffei, 2001, p. 50).
48. Page 12
49. And further:
50. The term building type was used in the past and still is today to indicate any group of buildings, with some characteristics, or a series of characteristics, in common (Caniggia & Maffei, 2001, p. 50).
51. A phase is defined as a reasonable distance in time that allows distinctive and consistent differences between two consecutive types to emerge. 
52. The typological process is as complicated as the urban landscape it lies  (Petruccioli, 1998a).
53. Caniggia’s examination of the spatial correlation of built objects is based on a set of subdivisions that forms a hierarchy (Figure 2). 
54. The components are: elements, a structure of elements, a system of structures, and an organism of [[systems]].
55. Page 13
56. A number of particular structures grouped together in a similar manner form a unit of a higher order, i.e. the system. The same idea can be taken further, whereby a grouping of systems forms a unit of an even higher order. In Caniggia’s terminology, this is known as an organism of systems. To provide further clarification, it is useful to consider examples of how Caniggia used these concepts in his work.
57. Urban tissue is defined as the ‘aggregation of building type, surrounding space and access ways’. The combination of tissues forms regions or districts (i.e., the system of structures (Figure 2), which together form the organism of the town (Caniggia, 1997).
58. Page 14
59. Caniggia defines urban tissue as follows: Formative laws and categories that are as typological as the “[[building type]]” can be summed up in one single term, urban tissue. A tissue is to an aggregate what building type is to building: tissue is the concept of the coexistence of several buildings existing in the minds of builders before the act of building, at the level of spontaneous consciousness, as a civil result of the experience of putting together several buildings and summing up all interesting aspects, including aggregation. Briefly, it is “a priori synthesis” of “building type”; we can then transfer to the term “tissue” the characteristics of both “building type” and “type” in its more general accepted meaning (Caniggia, 1979, pp. 118-119).
60. Whitehand’s Urban Morphology Research Group
61. Today urban morphology is a growing subject, with research taking place all over the world. JWR Whitehand has played a central role in this development. 
62. Page 15
63. Kristjánsdóttir (2001) discusses a possible integration of Caniggia’s theory on typological process with the fringe-belt concept put forward by Conzen. 
64. Kai Gu (2001), followed by Whitehand and Gu (2003), applied the concepts of urban morphology to study the Chinese city of Pingyao.
