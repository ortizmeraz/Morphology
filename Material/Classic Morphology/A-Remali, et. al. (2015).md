2. Centrality, a product of the street network’s configuration, has been identified as a significant driver of the ability of cities to support the development of diversity and intensity of city uses and users over time, thus reinforcing self-surveillance and community capacity.

4. In this study we explore the relationship between street front quality and social life in streets, as characterised in streets with different degrees of centrality in the contemporary city centre of Tripoli.
5. Within each of the three character areas, streets are classified on the basis of their degree of centrality in the broader urban network. Secondly, one 400m × 400m edged, squared sample is extracted in each character area such that the centre of the sample lies on a highly central street; the three 400m × 400m case studies are therefore identified.
6. Measuring street centrality Since the mid-1980s street centrality has grown continuously as a subject for study in urban design (Hillier and Hanson 1984; Hillier 1996; Marshall 2005; Porta et al. 2010) and the science of complex networks (Barthelemy 2011). Central streets are identified as significant features in the evolution of the urban fabric (Conzen 1960; Caniggia and Maffei 2001), directly affecting in many ways its liveability (Jacobs 1961; Jacobs 1993; Newman and Kenworthy 1999).
7. Multiple Centrality Assessment (MCA) is a computer-operated procedure that allows the mapping and calculation of the centrality of street networks, where the streets are represented as network links, and the intersections between them as nodes.

9. Centrality can be measured according to different indices, for example ‘straightness’, ‘closeness’ and ‘betweenness’; in this research we have only utilised betweenness centrality, which is effectively the same as the measure of ‘choice’ used in space syntax (see the Glossary). The betweenness centrality of an intersection is calculated as the number of shortest paths connecting all pairs of intersections in the system. The betweenness of a street is then measured as the average betweenness of its two defining intersections (namely, the intersections at either end of each of the streets). Therefore, routes with high ‘betweenness’ have the potential to support the active presence of people and the resultant urban economy (Porta et al. 2006).
10. Measuring street front quality
11. The space between the building façade and the public right-of-way is an essential part of the image and the character of a street, and is dependent on the positive interaction between ground-floor uses and the public pavement.
12. Street fronts are identified and their metric lengths are measured. A quantitative analysis of the distribution of street fronts across the three types is undertaken in order to provide insight
13. Page 6
14. ...into the impact of different street network models on the structure of the urban form.
15. The research team inspected 50m of street at a time, using five indicators: number of visible units accessible from the street (S); visible diversity of function (F); openness to the public street (O); level of maintenance (M); and level of detail and quality of materials (D). Scores were assigned separately for the five indicators, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 7 (highest); street fronts with no building alignment are attributed a value of 1 (lowest) across all indicators. This index ranges from a minimum of five (all five indicators are equal to one) to a maximum of thirty-five (all are equal to seven), Number of Units (S) is defined as the number of units that are visible and accessible from the street. A unit is defined as a functionally homogeneous and autonomous part of the building that is accessible from the street, for example a residential apartment, a shop or an independent storage space.
16. Page 7
17. Diversity of Functions (F) is defined as the number of different land uses that are visible from the street.
18. The ‘transparency’ of the street edge is regarded as conducive to more social interaction in a public space. An appropriate level of physical and visual openness between the inner spaces of buildings and the public realm contributes to a thriving social life and to safer outdoor spaces. Openness (O) is defined as the percentage of windows (or shop windows) that are visible from the street, measured in metric length against the total length of the homogeneous street section. Maintenance (M) is defined as the level of maintenance of the façade’s structures, materials and finish.
19. Page 8
20. Details and Materials (D) is defined as the level of quality and intensity of architectural details and building materials. In the street life survey we first simplify the Street Front Quality classification into: ‘good’, ‘average’ and ‘poor’. The ‘good’ category includes all streets whose Street Front Quality was either ‘exciting’, ‘attractive’ or ‘pleasant’; the ‘average’ category includes those previously classified as ‘average’; and the ‘poor’ category includes those previously classified as ‘dull’ or ‘unattractive’.

22. The survey accounts for the number of people engaged in the activities of walking, standing and sitting, and distinguishing the nature of those activities based on Jan Gehl’s (1987) terminology: necessary, optional or social.
23. Necessary activities are undertaken individually by necessity in a certain space, typically including, for example, walking to the next rail station, shopping in a large store or fixing a lamppost. Optional activities include all those undertaken individually by choice in a specific place, for example having a rest on a bench, indulging in conversation with friends over a coffee, reading in a park, strolling around and walking the dog.
24. Social activities are undertaken in a way that implies a significant amount of contact and exchange with others, either in a pair, trio or larger group.
- Walking is measured in people/hour: the number of people passing through the survey ‘gate’.
- Standing is measured in people/hour: the number of people standing within the 100m street, centred on the ‘gate’.
- Sitting is measured in people/hour: the number of people sitting within the 100m street, centred on the ‘gate’.
25. Tripoli’s districts
26. Tripoli’s city centre is made up of three distinct parts (Figure 5.1). The Old Town, originally established under the roman Empire in 111 ce and later transformed into an Islamic city after the Arab Muslims...
27. The Italian Quarter, developed after Italy invaded Libya in 1911, is located south and east of the Old Town and dominates most of the city centre with a colonial urban form and organisational distributional pattern.
28. ... the Garden City, which was developed during the British military administration after the Second World War

30. Streets and street centrality
31. On the basis of the classification of streets into main streets, connectors and cul-de-sacs, the total length of street front per type is then calculated
32. Page 14
33. for the three case study areas, revealing profound differences between them (Table 5.1).
34. Street front quality
35. Street front quality is measured on the street fronts of all streets included in the three 400m × 400m cases (Figure 5.5a, b and c)
36. Page 18
37. In this research we can observe a combination of two emerging patterns: (a) of the overall street network, main streets account for the largest proportion of streets sampled in the Old Town and the Italian Quarter, but not in the Garden City; (b) accordingly, ‘good’ quality street fronts (combining ‘attractive’ and ‘pleasant’) are a considerable proportion of all street fronts in both the Old Town and the Italian Quarter (around 40 per cent),
38. Page 21
39. Street life
40. Due to adverse security conditions in the city of Tripoli at the time of the field survey, Street Life is measured only on a subset of streets, but never theless covers all the classes of street centrality available on the ground.
41. Page 23
42. In general, there is clear evidence that the ‘street life double rule’ applies, although with a minor exception in main streets during peak times where slightly more people were detected on ‘poor’ than on ‘good’ streets. Whilst further research is required to discover whether these results apply elsewhere, this study has shown a consistent pattern across three diverse case studies: the amount of human activity on streets increases with the centrality of streets, and also with the quality of their frontages.
43. Page 26
44. Our observations have shown clearly that as centrality increases, city life follows. One might think that this is caused by the colonisation of rapidly disappearing traditional lifestyles by Western social habits and cultural norms, but this research suggests the opposite: in the Old Town this pattern is in fact even sharper, with nearly 70 per cent of street life happening on main streets.
45. A third, important general pattern emerges according to which optional and social activities tend to follow the quality of the street fronts, while necessary activities follow an inverse pattern and are found in greater quantity as street front quality decreases.
46. Page 27
47. In addition to the urban design properties of the three sample areas, it is possible to draw conclusions about the characteristics of their centrality in broader terms.
