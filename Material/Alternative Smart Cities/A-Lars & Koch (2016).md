```ad-abstract
In light of the urgent threats presented by climate change and rapid urbanisation, interest in ‘smart city systems’ is mounting. In contrast to scholarship that poses ‘smartness’ as something that needs to be added to cities, recent developments in spatial morphology research pursue a view of the built fabric of cities as an extension of the cognitive human apparatus, as well as a material formulation of social, cultural and economic relations and processes. The built fabric of cities needs to be understood as a highly intelligent artefact in itself, rather than simple, dead matter. The current focus on high-tech systems risks concealing the fact that the machine is already there. In contrast to the technological ‘implements’ of smart city systems, this article looks at cities as ‘facilities’ – that is, as technologies that slow down, store and maintain energy as a resource for a variety of purposes. The article builds on space syntax research in order to give precision to the understanding of the affordances the cities offer their various processes and the ways in which cities operate as information storage and retrieval devices for individuals and for society. The city must be considered, we argue, in terms of a range of tangled, interdependent systems, reaching from individual buildings to the whole city, an understanding anchored in notions of ‘diversity’ and ‘density’ (recently gathered under the concept of ‘spatial capital’) and in research addressing how the distribution of space and artefacts serve as means of knowledge communication (specifically, in complex buildings such as libraries and department stores). In conclusion, we argue that existing discussions on ‘smart city systems’ would benefit acknowledgement of the role of cities as facilities.

## Bullet points
1. Naturally, the aim of effecting such a translation results from a desire to increase precision and efficiency, but it also runs the risk of hiding the fact that, as it were, the machine is already in place. P 206
2. The current smart city discussion tends to focus on ‘implements’ – for instance, integrated electronic communications systems – which are treated as a sort of new smart layer to be added to the urban landscape. P 207
3. In the following paper, we address this technological duality by building on space syntax research, which represents a research direction that for several decades has explored how knowledge and social relations are embedded in the spatial form of cities and buildings. P 207
4. Space syntax models therefore operate in a kind of in-between; they are deduced from spatial geometry, but the way they are deduced is based on how spatial form embeds and communicates cognitive and social information. P 208
5. The cognitive argument - The means of description constitute a primary concern in the methodologies of space syntax research, the specific aim of which has been to develop geometric representations of space that may capture the embedding of social relations in the built fabric.
6. The social argument - Interrelated to their cognitive dimension, space syntax models also represent the built environment as a material formation of social relations and processes. By analysing architectural space through models that capture both differentiation (that is, how space is to various degrees subdivided into separate places) and connection (that is, how space is connected and separated to form relations, sequences and systems), the social potentials of a particular space can be elucidated.
