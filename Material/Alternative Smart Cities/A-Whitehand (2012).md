```ad-abstract
A number of **challenges facing urban morphology** are examined. **Several** of these **relate to the multidisciplinary character of research on urban form** and the tendency for relevant disciplines to be poorly connected. The issues discussed, a number of which are prominent more widely within the social sciences and humanities, **include poor communication between different linguistic areas; underrepresentation of research on non-Western cities**; the tendency for studies to be place specific; and the poor relationship between research and practice. ISUF is having some success in leading attempts to meet these challenges.

## Bullet points
1. As a field of knowledge it has existed for over 100 years, but it is not a widely recognized discipline. It lacks a range of journals devoted exclusively to it. It largely lacks national organizational bodies. Formal degree courses in urban morphology are rare and text books are few.
2. The diverse character of urban morphology, especially its multidisciplinarity, is a logical starting point for consideration of a range of matters that urban morphologists need to consider more energetically than hitherto. Most of the issues considered here are shared to varying degree by a number of the disciplines to which urban morphology is connected.
3. The tendency in the course of the twentieth century for citations of research to be increasingly dominated by those of publications in English has been well documented in geography (Harris, 2001; Whitehand and Edmondson, 1977).
4. Anglophone squint has been compounded by the emphasis that the widely-available indexes have given to journals published in English. From its inception the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), now part of Thomson Reuters, concentrated largely on journals in the English language. Consequently citations of non-anglophone authors have been greatly under-represented in these indexes.
5. In practice, nearly all articles submitted to Urban Morphology are in English. Inevitably, therefore, some referees are receiving articles to referee that are not in their first language.
6. The tendency to overlook cities outside Europe and North America (that is, broadly speaking outside Western countries) is an aspect of what might be dubbed the problem of EuroAmerican myopia.
7. The case for a more balanced geographical coverage of the world’s urban areas, notably the inclusion of more in Asia, South America and Africa, would seem hard to refute.
8. One of the perceptive pieces of advice that Albrecht Penck gave his students in the University of Berlin nearly 100 years ago was **‘when you see the particular, always look for the general’** (M. R. G. Conzen, personal communication). The general purport of this guidance would seem clear – **when a specific observation is made, the more general aspects to which it may be related should be considered**.
9. The weak relationship between research and practice is an acknowledged problem in a number of fields. There is a tendency, particularly in the social sciences and humanities, for academic research and policy to exist in largely separate worlds.
10. Attempts to bring the worlds of research and policy closer have been numerous. They have taken various forms.
