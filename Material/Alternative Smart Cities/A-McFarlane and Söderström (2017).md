  ```ad-abstract
  **Smart urbanism** seems to be everywhere you turn. But in practice the **agenda is an uncertain one, usually only partially developed, and often more about corporate-led urban development** **than about urban social justice**. Rather than leave smart urbanism to the corporate and political elites, **there are opportunities now for critical urban scholarship to not only critique how it is currently constituted, but to give shape to a globally oriented alternative smart urban agenda.** An ambition like this means taking the ‘urban’ in ‘smart urban’ much more seriously. It means foregrounding the knowledges, political priorities and needs of those either actively excluded or included in damaging ways in mainstream smart urban discourses. **We outline steps towards an alternative smart urbanism. We seek to move beyond the specific to the general and do so by drawing on radically different initiatives across the Global North and South.** These initiatives provide tantalizing openings to a more socially just use of digital technology, where urban priorities and justice drive the use—or lack of use—of technology.

## Bullet points
1. Smart urbanism is a loosely connected set of confluences between data, digital technologies, and urban sites and processes. The promise continually sold is of the digitally enabled data-driven, continually sensed, responsive and integrated urban environment. … densities of people, traffic, goods, even weather—such as in flash flooding, in Rio’s case—are managed here (so the claims go) through a new urban informatics.
2. Recent critical scholarship identifies a series of risks in dominant formulations of what SU consists of: the obfuscation of the negative effects of IT on cities (Hollands 2008), a return to the failed utopias of 20th-century high modernism (Greenfield 2013), the rise of technocratic governance (Kitchin 2014), the discrimination of ‘non-smart’ citizens (Vanolo 2014) or the prioritization of IT networks over other more urgent needs in municipal agendas (Söderström, Paasche, and Klauser 2014).
3. They suggest a theorization that includes six axes: ‘smart economy; smart mobility; a smart environment; smart people; smart living; and, finally, smart governance’ (70). Their aim is to put more emphasis on social inclusion, social capital and sustainability. We welcome this, but we also need to identify the core of SU.
4. This cybernetic imaginary is functional to promoting and selling smart urban technologies, and adding new themes does not itself challenge it. If we want to overcome the trap of technocratic governance and the technology-push ethos, common in engineering sciences and of course in IT corporations, a more radical critique is needed. This critique should not evacuate the role of technology, which is central to the genealogy of SU.
5. Knowledge is etymologically at the root of the word ‘smart’. It may have become the standard move to reach for the Oxford English Dictionary, but it’s important to keep firmly in mind that the adjective smart is a very old word related to two semantic fields…. Dominant SU discourses—given that they emerge first and foremost from companies who, after all, are selling commodities—generally push the second conception, and connect smart etymologically primarily to technology rather than to intelligence and knowledge.
6. Rather than leave smart to the corporate elites, the critical purchase of our intervention is to argue that an alternative SU can be generated through foregrounding smart in the lifeworlds of different marginalized groups in the city.
7. …alternative SU should of course not be technology adverse. However, instead of technology-push strategies of urban management, a knowledge-intensive SU should strive to shape technology to put it in the service of social improvement.
8. The need to balance the role of technology and knowledge is crucial to an alternative SU. As our example of smart sensing infrastructures shows, to socially shape technology is a process that needs to be subtly attuned to the specificity of places if we want to promote social justice.
9. These general principles of an alternative knowledge-intensive rather than technology-intensive SU are not simple intellectual speculations: they are enacted by activists and scholars in many cities in the world.
