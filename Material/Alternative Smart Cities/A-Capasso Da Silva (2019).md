```ad-abstract
Cities can enhance their sustainability planning by prioritizing accessibility as a performance metric for transportation planning. In this context, accessibility measures the ease of reaching opportunities and captures more characteristics of sustainable cities than the more conventionally used mobility metrics, focusing on the overall ability to move and generally recommending faster speeds to overcome distance. However, how cities can prioritize accessibility in planning is understudied.  
This research presents a case of Tempe, Arizona, putting accessibility into practice through a 20-min lens. Using a 20-min threshold for all modes, the city aims to promote travel for daily activities that is less reliant on private autos. The analysis presented here documents the challenges that planners face when planning for accessibility. The challenges range from technical points to decisions that need to be made about the quality of the built environment. The analysis also shows that Tempe, which is a classically suburban city of wide roads and single-family homes that was built around the automobile, is highly accessible by a 20-min metric by bicycling, walking and transit. These results  suggest that planners focus on street network improvements that prioritize accessibility as part of a sustainability strategy.

This article, just as the majority assessing the accessibility to services and amenities  ignores the articulation between the urban form, the land-use, and the means of transportation. However, as it is an applied case to a somewhat homogeneous city, it replaces it with the analysis of the bike ready and pedestrian infrastructure. 

## Bullet points
1. In recent years, accessibility research has developed measures of access to opportunities [2–7], and more cities and regions are looking to accessibility improvements as a guiding principle for transport goals.
2. Accessibility measures offer a clearer sense as to what people value in cities, which is the ease of reaching the places they want to go. Applying the concept of accessibility in practice presents a new set of challenges [13], however. Accessibility is a metric, but what are acceptable parameters of what is considered accessible must be set through policy.
3. Another way that accessibility is brought into practice is through the concept of a 20-min city.
4. The 20-min city concept has evolved from Portland’s 20-min neighborhood concept, which envisioned a neighborhood where residents were able to access daily activities within twenty minutes, ideally by walking, but alternatively by bike, transit, or even car [14].
5. From a planning perspective, though, access to jobs is more of a regional issue than a local issue. Jobs are dispersed throughout a metropolitan region and maintaining jobs-housing balance within individual cities may not be the most sustainable path forward. Job seekers are better off if they are able to access the largest number of jobs, which for most metro areas is by car.
6. To measure and assess the City of Tempe infrastructure and development priorities, researchers analyzed current conditions to identify tangible performance measures. These analyses included three aspects:
	1. Destinations: Identification of daily necessities and quality of life amenities. The set of 12 non-work destinations was selected based on input from Tempe dwellers. Table 1 describes the list of destination groups used in this analysis.
	2.  Networks: The creation of scenarios that allow the assessment of the three transportation modes (pedestrian, bicycle, and transit), regarding compliance with the 20-min city guidelines. The networks were created to simulate five different scenarios within the city. The analysis was conducted for biking on any road, biking on low-stress roads, walking on any road, walking on roads with sidewalks, and for using public transit. Unpaved paths were not considered in any of the analyses, given the fact that in this case study the segments indicated as unpaved were not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.
	3.  Travel Sheds and Coverage: The comparison of the 20-min City network against the full city limits and the number of residential units reached in each of the five selected scenarios. The travel shed and coverage analysis was done for all twelve destination groups, in five scenarios, based on a network assessment for biking on any road, biking on low-stress roads, walking on any road, walking on roads with sidewalks, and for using public transit. Each of the scenarios had its own specifications in terms of accepted distance from the facility to the closest road, as well as accepted distance to be covered on the network. Those specifications are described in the following subsections.
7. The analysis of several sets of data from different sources provided the baseline conditions in regard of being a 20-min city. The 20-min assessment primarily used three types of data: Destination data, network data, and residential parcels data.
	1.  The decision on what data to be used was made based on the priorities identified by city residents, and availability to city officials.

8. The network analysis was done exclusively on city of Tempe roads, meaning that only destinations within a short distance from the city border were considered (one-eighth of a mile for pedestrian and transit networks, one-quarter of a mile for bicycling networks).

11. A suburban city like Tempe is unlikely to balance jobs and housing in a way that allows for substantial reductions in car commuting simply because employment within the region is so spread out spatially. So, to connect accessibility targets with sustainability goals, the city wants to develop planning interventions that facilitate non-auto travel for daily and weekly nonwork needs. A 20-min city analysis for non-work home-based travel provides a framework for lanning infrastructure upgrades and other interventions that may enhance sustainable travel trips in the US [24].

12. Evaluating qualities of the built environment can be done through inventories, such as an adapted Irvine-Minnesota Inventory [25].
13. **Conclusions**
14. The analysis presented is a case study of how accessibility can be used in practice through a 20-min city program. The process and hierarchy of decision making described was used to create a baseline for 20-min city planning interventions. Creating baseline measures of a 20-min city requires many decisions about seemingly minor details, but the decisions must be made deliberately for legitimacy, replication, and to ensure that city priorities are considered.
