# Alternatives to automobility


The research explores into the relationship and articulations between **transportation**, **land use**, and **urban form**.  

The exploration is done by unveiling the articulations between the elements and how they produce complex systems.  

This research explores alternatives to the high cost of adopting automobility as primary way of transportation.

The social relevance of the research lies on the contributions to planning and how urban spaces can be retrofitted to decrease the automobile dependence without affecting the quality of life in said spaces.

The dependence on the automobile is not measured directly.


The frame work includes the creation of a systems approach. Where the spatial logic of the built space  

The approach analyze the system as a whole and not a selection of constituent elements and their specific interactions, causations,  and dependencies. Nor by big data approach where data is analyzed to find the 

The research will jump from the [[node place]] approach and increase the scope to include the study of the [[urban form]],  and the network analysis of the transit network.

## Objectives of the Research

The general aim of the research is to better assess accessibility potential to primary commercial and community amenities and services in Montréal created by the interactions of **urban forms**, **public transport systems**, and **land-use patterns**.

The general objective is to analyze quantitatively and to characterize the accessibility to primary commercial and community amenities and services from Montréal’s residential spaces.

To achieve this, specific objectives are:

1. [[urban form question]] To explain how different combinations of urban form, local conditions of public transit, and land use, result in different levels of performance.

2. [[transit question]]To develop an integrated set of indicators measuring accessibility, based on the spatial properties of the urban fabrics; the commercial the public transport networks, and the primary commercial and community land-uses. And an Accessibility Performance Index.

3. [[land use question]]To develop a Taxonomy of residential environments associated with differing levels of accessibility in Montréal regarding to the the services and the sustanibility associated to the use of mass transit. (and to map the residential environments that correspond to the taxonomy’s classes).

           
## Expected result
A framework that allows to recognize the **urban fabric**, **the transit network**, and the **land use** combine to provide configurations and which give desirable outcome.

Urban morphology > to categorize the material space from the systems created by the transit network and the land use










Place node is how we define heuristic model that leads to that uses quantitative methods to characterize and classify “configurations” (replace with better concept, modalities? Articulations?) of place attributes and transportation node attributes.

Transportation is related to land use, it is a bidirectional relationship

Classical morphology can lead to quantification, he would includer Hiller and space syntax, unless there is another reason to

What is uM, the nature of the approach, what are the objects of UM and the purpose and outcomes. Can entail quantification. He would rather to bring bergahouser earlier work with hiller on the Classical morphology. There could be a theoretical underling position, that says that the system is speaking about the spatial distro of pop and activities, and the built forms that accommodate the activities. Including basic transportation an d land use. For years the urban form entails, the spatial form the activities that house was predicated on walking, with the shift of the mechanized transportation, commuting, leading up to the automobile. This will be an axis or underlying hypothesis. It might not be expressed directly or not.

In the second one explores the condition

Place node is a subset of analysis that explores how the place characteristics is articulated to transportation nodes. And identify potential for future transportations, it can help identify balanced and unbalanced circumstances, where there too much place. More globally allowed to understand contrasting realities and how they compose the system.

From there we jump to the Transportation is related to land use, it is a bidirectional relationship, look if Meta has done anything there.
