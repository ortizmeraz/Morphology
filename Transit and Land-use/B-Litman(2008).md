This paper discusses the concept of accessibility and how it can be incorporated in transport planning. Accessibility refers to people’s ability to reach goods, services and activities, which is the ultimate goal of most transport activity. Many factors affect accessibility, including mobility (physical movement), the quality and affordability of transport options, transport system connectivity, mobility substitutes, and land use patterns. Accessibility can be evaluated from various perspectives, including a particular group, mode, location or activity. Conventional planning tends to overlook and undervalue some of these factors and perspectives. More comprehensive analysis of accessibility in planning expands the scope of potential solutions to transport problems.

## Bullet points

2. There is no single way to evaluate accessibility. Different planning issues require different methods to account for different users, modes, scales and perspectives. For example, neighborhood planning requires more walkability analysis, while regional planning requires more analysis of automobile, bus and rail travel. Evaluating access for lower-income populations differs from that of wealthier and business travelers.

4. **Defining Accessibility**
5. Accessibility (or just access) refers to the ease of reaching goods, services, activities and destinations, which together are called opportunities. It can be defined as the potential for interaction and exchange (Hansen 1959; Engwicht 1993).
6. Access is the goal of most transport activity, Various disciplines analyze accessibility, but their perspective is often limited:
	1. Transport planners generally focus on mobility, particularly vehicle travel.
	2. Land use planners generally focus on geographic accessibility (distances between activities).
	3. Communications experts focus on telecommunication quality (such as the portion of households with access to telephone, cable and Internet services).
	4. Social service planners focus on accessibility options for specific groups to specific services (such as disabled people’s ability to reach medical clinics and recreation centers)
	5. The words accessibility and access can have various meanings and implications.
	6. In the fields of geography and urban economics, accessibility refers to the relative ease of reaching a particular location or area.
	7. In pedestrian planning and facility design accessible design (also called universal design) refers to facilities designed to accommodate people with disabilities. For example, a pathway designed to accommodate people in wheelchairs may be called accessible
	8. In social planning, accessibility refers to people’s ability to use services and opportunities.

8. Accessibility-based analysis therefore expands the range of possible solutions to transport problems, which can lead to better solutions. For example, if a school experiences traffic or parking congestion problems, vehicle-travel-based analysis would conclude that roads and parking facilities must be expanded. Mobility-based analysis would conclude that roads and parking facilities could be expanded, or that students could travel by bus, rather than drive alone. Accessibility-based analysis would compare those solutions with others, such as locating more schools in neighborhoods where the distance that children must travel to school is short enough to allow more walking and cycling. This solution offers many additional benefits, including infrastructure cost savings (reduced road and parking requirements), user cost savings (parents no longer need to drive),  reduced pollution emissions, and increased fitness and health.

10. **Mobility**
11. Mobility refers to physical movement, measured by trips, distance and speed, such as person-miles or –kilometers for personal travel, and ton-miles or tonne-kilometers for freight travel. All else being equal, increased mobility increases accessibility: the more and faster people can travel the more destinations they can reach.

13. **Integration, Terminals and Parking**
14. Accessibility is affected by the quality of system integration, such as the ease of transferring between modes, the quality of stations and terminals, and parking convenience.
15. The integration of other modes varies significantly, and inadequate integration is sometimes a major barrier to non-automobile accessibility. For example, airports and ferry terminals are sometimes difficult to access by public transit, and bus stops and train stations are sometimes uncomfortable and difficult to access, particularly by people with disabilities, children, and people carrying heavy loads. Some destinations lack suitable bicycle parking and changing facilities. It is often difficult to obtain accurate information on alternative modes.
16. Implications:
	1. The connections between links and modes affect accessibility.
	2. The location and quality of transportation terminals affects the accessibility of the modes they serve. The quality of bus stops, train stations, ferry terminals and other transfer facilities affects the relative accessibility of these modes.
	3. The availability, price and convenience of parking affect automobile accessibility.
	4. Bicycle transportation is facilitated by appropriate bicycle parking and storage facilities (including some covered and secure parking), and changing facilities at worksites.

18. **Land Use Factors**
19. Various land use (also called geographic, urban form and built environment) factors affect accessibility (Litman 2005), including density, mix, connectivity and walkability.
20. A more accessible land use pattern (called smart growth) means that less mobility is needed to reach activities and destinations. A typical household’s accessibility can be envisioned as a triangle connecting home, work and services. Travel distances and options among these destinations affect overall accessibility. For example, improving the variety of services (shops, schools, restaurants, parks, etc.) within a neighborhood or worksite, and improving travel options from home to worksite, tends to increase accessibility and reduce transport expenditures.
21. Implications:
	1. Increased density and clustering of activities tends to increase accessibility.
	2. Shorter travel distances can improve transport options (particularly walking)

22. Page 16
23. Density refers to the number of people or jobs per acre. Clustering refers to people and activities locating together. Density and clustering are somewhat different concepts. Low density areas can have a high degree of clustering, such as rural residents and businesses locating in villages. Land use mix refers to various types of land use (residential, commercial, institutional, recreational, etc.) located close together. Land use density, clustering and mix tend to increase accessibility (Hine and Grieco 2003). For example, a neighborhood or activity center with housing, stores, offices and transport services located close together provides a high level of accessibility.
24. Page 17
25. The relationship between density and accessibility is complex, because increased density and clustering can increase traffic and parking congestion, which reduces automobile accessibility. Other modes, such as walking and public transit, require less space and benefit from density. Clustering activities into a compact center (such as a downtown or mall) makes it feasible to perform numerous errands with one vehicle trip, which is helpful to motorists and even more helpful to transit users.
26. Implications:
	1. Clustering and mixing of common destinations increases accessibility.
	2. Generous parking supply tends to improve automobile access but can reduce accessibility by other modes.
	3. Clustering transportation services into centers and terminals increases accessibility.
	4. Increasing building height or reducing the amount of land around buildings devoted to parking can increase density and accessibility.
	5. Certain types of clustering can provide economies of agglomeration.
	6. Density and clustering may create vehicle traffic and parking congestion, but this may be offset if increased accessibility and transportation diversity reduce vehicle traffic.

28. **Transportation Network Connectivity**
29. Road and path connectivity (also called permeability) affect accessibility. Increased connectivity tends to increase accessibility. A grid network (Figure 9), with shorter connected roads, tends provide relatively good accessibility due to multiple routes, more direct connections between destinations, and narrower streets with lower traffic speeds that are better suited to walking and cycling, and therefore to public transit travel (since most transit trips involve walking links).
30. Page 23
31. **The Value of Inaccessibility**
32. Most transport planning assumes that increased accessibility and mobility provide net benefits to society. Yet, inaccessibility provides benefits and increased mobility often imposes significant external costs. For example, many people dream of living on an isolated rural community or island for the sake of quiet, privacy and community cohesion. Expanded transport facilities and increased vehicle traffic impose significant external costs (such as increased infrastructure costs, congestion, accident risk, neighborhood disruptions, energy consumption and pollution emissions) which may offset much of the benefits of increased mobility. Comprehensive analysis of accessibility and mobility should therefore account for these external costs, and not assume that increased accessibility and mobility are necessarily beneficial.
33. Implications:
	1. Current planning generally fails to consider the disamenities associated with increased accessibility and the external costs of increased mobility, and so tends to overstate the benefits of increased access and mobility.
	2. To the degree that automobile travel is underpriced, current levels of motor vehicle travel will be economically excessive, and accommodating this demand is likely to be economically harmful.
	3. Communities may be better off limiting accessibility and mobility, particularly where isolation, quiet, independence and community cohesion are valued, and vehicle travel may impose significant externalities.
34. Page 25
35. Basic accessibility analysis investigates people’s ability to reach goods and services considered basic or essential, such as medical care, basic shopping, education, employment, and a certain amount of social and recreational opportunities. This requires categorizing people according to attributes such as:
	1. Vehicle accessibility (degree that people have a motor vehicle available for their use).
	2. Physical and communication ability (consideration of various types of disabilities, including ambulatory, visual, auditory, inability to read, etc.).
	3. Income. In general, people in the lowest income quintile can be considered poor.
	4. Commuting. The degree to which people must travel regularly to school or work.
	5. Dependencies. The degree to which people care for children or dependent adults.
36. Page 26
37. **Location**
38. A particular location’s accessibility can be evaluated based on distances and mobility options to common destinations. For example, some areas are automobile-oriented, located on major highways with abundant parking, poor pedestrian and transit access, and few nearby activities.
39. Page 28
40. Current evaluation practices tend to measure mobility rather than overall accessibility.
41. Traffic models are commonly used to evaluate automobile and transit service quality.
42. They measure travel speeds, operating costs and fares. Such models only account for travel between zones, not travel within zones; many fail to account for generated traffic impacts (which overstates the congestion reduction benefits of roadway capacity expansion); few incorporate transit service quality factors other than travel speed; and they often do a poor job of predicting the impacts of mobility management strategies such as pricing reforms, HOV priority measures or improved user information.
43. How certain factors are measured can significantly affect analysis results. For example:
	1. Accessibility should generally be measured door-to-door, taking into account the travel links from origins to vehicles and from vehicles to destinations. For example, delays finding a parking space should be counted as part of travel time costs.
	2. Travel time costs should reflect factors such as comfort and convenience. For example, congestion and crowding increase unit costs (“Travel Time Costs,” Litman, 2006a).
	3. Travel distances should be based on actual network conditions, rather than as-the-crow-flies.
	4. Accessibility analysis should consider costs such as vehicle ownership and parking, not just vehicle operating costs.

44. Current transportation evaluation methods often fail to incorporate many these factors (Geurs 2006).
45. They generally focus on easier-to-measure impacts at the expense of more difficult to measure impacts. For example, current transport models generally assign the same travel time cost value to all travel, regardless of comfort and convenience. This favors transport system improvements that increase vehicle travel speeds over improvements that increase travel comfort and convenience (such as nicer walking conditions, more pleasant transit waiting areas and reduced transit vehicle crowding).
46. The Access to Destinations study (El-Geneidy and Levinson 2006) uses detailed data on land use, travel behavior, and population demographics to evaluate accessibility in a particular situation. It involves the following steps:
	1. Accessibility definition. A consistent definition of accessibility is needed that can be applied to various modes.
	2. Land use activities. Destination information can be developed by activity type (e.g., employment, housing, retail, education, and recreation).
	3. Accessibility by mode to destinations. This information can be used to measure accessibility by mode for specific activities and geographic locations in order to compare accessibility for different groups (such as motorists versus non-drivers, and residents of specific neighborhoods), and track how this changes over time or in response to planning decisions.
47. Page 32
48. Special analysis can evaluate the quality of accessibility for specific groups and locations.
49. For example, evaluation of accessibility by elementary students should include analysis of the convenience, comfort, safety, affordability and speed of walking, cycling, automobile and school bus service. Similarly, evaluating accessibility of a commercial district should include analysis of the quality of walking, cycling, automobile, public transit, taxi service and parking conditions.
50. Page 34
51. **Optimal Accessibility and Mobility**
52. It is interesting to consider the levels of accessibility and mobility that are overall optimal, and how this is affected by the evaluation methods used. Transportation planning often assumes that any increase in mobility is beneficial and desirable, but there are, of course, various economic, social and environmental costs.

54. **Strategies for Improving Accessibility**
55. This section describes various ways to improve accessibility. For more information see VTPI (2006)
56. Table 12 uses the list of factors that affect accessibility from Table 5 to help identify possible ways of improving accessibility. Current transport planning and evaluation practices tend to focus on certain types of accessibility improvements, particularly those that increase motor vehicle travel speeds and parking convenience, which limits the scope of potential solutions to transport problems.
	1. Access and Mobility Demand |Use research to better understand people’s accessibility and mobility needs, preferences and abilities, and use social marketing strategies to develop better options that respond to these demand, and to encourage consumers to choose more efficient and equitable options.
	2. Basic Access and Mobility | Prioritize transportation improvements and activities to favor access to goods, services and activities considered most important to society.
	3. MobilityImprove traffic speed and capacity, such as improving and expanding roadways.
	4. Transportation Options | Improve the convenience, comfort, safety, reliability, affordability and speed of transport options, including walking, cycling, automobile, rideshare, taxi, carshare and public transit.
	5. User Information | Improve the quantity and quality of user information regarding travel and location options, including signs, maps, brochures, websites and telephone services. Special attention can be given to providing convenient information on alternative modes and efficient locations.
	6. Integration | Improve connections between different modes and destinations, such as more integrated information, fares, walkability, baggage transfers, automobile and bicycle parking.
	7. Affordability | Improve the quantity and quality of affordable modes (walking, cycling, ridesharing, public transit, taxi and telework), and improve housing affordability in accessible locations.
	8. Mobility Substitutes | Improve the quantity and quality of telecommunications and delivery services that substitute for physical travel.
	9. Land Use Factors |Improve land use accessibility by increasing density and mix, in order to create activity centers and urban villages that contain the appropriate combination of housing, jobs and services within convenient walking and cycling distance.
	10. Transport Network Connectivity | Improve road and path connectivity to allow more direct travel between destinations, including special shortcuts for non-motorized travel where appropriate.
	11. Roadway Design and Management | Improve roadways to increase traffic flow (for example, by reducing the number of driveways), to favor higher occupant vehicles, and to improve walking and cycling conditions.
	12. Prioritization | Use mobility and parking management strategies to favor higher value trips and more resource-efficient vehicles, and to encourage more accessible land use development.
	13. Improve Payment Systems | Better road and parking pricing methods reduce transaction costs and increase the feasibility of implementing pricing reforms to increase overall transportation system efficiency.
	14. Inaccessibility | Where appropriate, limit mobility and accessibility.

57. This table indicates various ways to improve accessibility. Current transport planning practices tend to focus on just a few of these strategies, which limits the scope of solutions considered.
