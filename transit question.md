# Land use distribution and transportation

To study the whole as a product of the parts that compose it. The objective is to measure, quantify, characterize the resulting environments from the interaction of the means of transportation and land use. Both at a local and global level.

The angle is not to unveil the entire system by crunching numbers without a theoretical perspective. These studies, try to reveal the patterns in the abstract. 
The city does not grow into random configurations possible. 
Before doing the processing, a theoretical model is built in a transversal fashion. The model considers the articulations between the transit network, the urban form, and the land use. Time budget is integrated to frame the theoretical model spatially and functionally. By creating categories and tiers of  accessibility to services and amenities. 




The transit question focuses on  the transit network from a network perspective. It studies the part-to-whole and part-to-part relationship of the entry/exit points and the services across the city.
Use the tools that explore the complex systems that explore land use and transportation, not as two different elements that interact but as parts of a system, adding the urban form to the equation. 



### **Extent** 
- This question starts: by evaluating the connectivity of the transit network to the urban tissue 
- This question covers: the different configurations and capacities that cover 
- The research objective is: to provide a guide for characterization of the capacity the transit network has to move urban dwellers across the urban tissue 
- The question ends with: a hierarchy of connectivity that describes the nodes of the transit network and
