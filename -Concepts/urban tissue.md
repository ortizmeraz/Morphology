### From MULTIVARIABLE DEFINITION OF DENSITY in [[Space Density and Urban Form]]

(urban) Fabric. The area of the fabric is similar to the scale and definitions used for a plan unit, as  described by Conzen, and the tessuto, as used by Caniggia (Moudon 1994). The urban fabric  consists of a collection of islands, as well as the network that surrounds these islands and  is required as access to the islands (access streets28). When linear green or water elements  such as the canals in the Grachtengordel in Amsterdam are part of the street pattern, these are considered as part of the network as well. The network area constitutes the tare space between island and fabric. The boundaries of the fabric are drawn in the middle of the access streets. In circumstances where there is no street, the boundaries of the fabric are set by the lot boundaries. The size of the fabric is determined by the level of homogeneity (spread) of the different islands within that fabric.

### From [[A-Newman (2016)]]
Urban fabrics in this theory are products of transport-related lifestyles and  
functions that have needed certain physical elements and environments to enable them. Each fabric has a particular set of spatial relationships, typology of buildings and specific land-use patterns that are based on their transport infrastructure priorities.

### From the Critical Glossary in [[B-Caniggia & Maffei (2017).]]
**Urban Tissue Type** - The concept of a system whereby several building types are grouped within a uniform historical domain, a concept shared by an individual agent ('the subject')  with other members of the community.

### From [[A-Hillier, W. (2016)]]
- The **[[foreground network]]**, through what I have called **the ‘city making process’, acquires the form of a pervasive network of** linked **centres** at all scales, and is **driven by microeconomic activity**,…
