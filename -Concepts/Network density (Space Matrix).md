# Network density (N)  
The density of the network, N, refers to the concentration of networks in an area, in our case  the fabric. The density of a network is defined as network length per square metre of base  land area (m/m2), and is calculated as the sum of the whole internal network and half of the  length of the network used to demarcate the base land area. The unit of the outcome is metre  of network per square metre of fabric area.

$N_{f}=\frac{\sum l_{i}+\frac{\sum l_{e}}{2}}{A_{f}}$

$l_{i}=$ length of the interior network (m)
$l_{e}=$ length of the edge network (m)
$A_{f}=$area of fabric $(m^{2})$
