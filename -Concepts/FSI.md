   ## Definition
   
   ### From Space Density and Urban From ()
   FSI reflects the building intensity independently of the programmatic composition and is  
calculated as follows for all levels of scale as described earlier

   $FIS=\frac{F_{x}}{A_{x}}$
   $F_{x}=$gross floor area $(m^{2})$
   $A_{x} =$ area of aggregation x$(m^{2})$
   x= aggregation (lot(l), island(i), fabric(f), or district(d))
