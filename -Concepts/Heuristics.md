# Heuristics
## Definition
Is a problem solving approach based on experience, testing, erring, and correcting. It is not focused on finding the exact or optimal result. This technique is meant to tackle an obstacle where an exact approach is impractical or impossible. 
Urban planning is an heuristic discipline, as it deals with the interactions of the built environment and the social machinery that occupies it. A complex process in constant evolution.
(urban) Planning is not tasked with obtaining exact answers, but to provide sound and reliable solutions within complex (city) systems. While certainties in the decision making process in urban scenarios would be ideal, in most cases, they are unattainable.

The term heuristic refers to the technique of solving problems based on experience and includes actions associated with finding, learning, discovering, testing, erring, and correcting. Heuristics aim to find a good enough solution in a space of possibilities. And while it may not be the best or optimal solution (but only a good one), it can address a particular business issue in the right time and in a feasible way. Typically the quest for the optimal solution demands more time, effort, technology, accurate data, and so on than is available in practice. And so chasing the best solution gives rise to hunting for a solution, the good enough solution that can address the business problem at hand.

Given the formulation of a spatial decision problem, the optimal solution can be obtained using an exact method. However, as discussed above, such an exact approach may become impractical when the size of the problem increases and additional factors must be considered in the decision process. It is critical, therefore, to explore a diverse set of solutions to the problem to enable a comprehensive examination of the solution space during the decision making process so that the decision makers can make their final choice. A second type of solution approach, called heuristics, can be used for this purpose. Heuristics are often more efficient compared with their exact counterparts, though they do not guarantee the global solutions to be found. The literature has generally suggested the effectiveness of heuristics in finding high quality solutions that are optimal or near optimal [5]. However, it has not been the focus of existing research to discuss how heuristic methods can be used to generate a diverse set of solutions to facilitate the decision process. In this section, I give a brief overview on the diversity of the solution methods. I will then discuss in the next section on how to utilize the diversity of these methods. A large number of heuristic methods for spatial optimization problems have been developed in the past few decades. A traditional approach to developing such a method is problem-specific and lacks the flexibility of applying to other problems. The effectiveness of this type of heuristics is evident in the literature [5, 7]. For example, the vertex exchange method developed to solve the p-median problem in location-allocation models [31], though highly effective [22], cannot be directly used for other location allocation problems such as the center problems without significant modifications. Another example is the heuristic method that is specifically designed to solve political redistricting problems [33].
In general, traditional heuristic methods can be considered in different categories. A simple approach is to develop a greedy algorithm that construct a complete, feasible solution by assigning the values to the decision variables step by step. During each step, a decision variable is assigned so that the solution appears to be the best at that step, which can be simply achieved by minimizing the increase of the objective function value caused by assigning the new decision variable (assuming minimization is the goal). A greedy algorithm can often be strikingly simple to develop but the performance may not be satisfactory for many problems, especially when the problems contain many local optimal solutions.

Faludi's second point (following Webber, 1983) regards the legacy that the systems approach left for planning as a profession. The problem was less that systems planning was doomed to failure and more about the illusions that it gave planners about eventually being able to achieve something akin to understanding and control:

[the] attractiveness of the idea of scientific planning has been hard to resist, for it held out the promise of right answers, of revealing what we should want, and of saying what we need to do. It seduces with the prospect of certainty, and thus with the prospect of relief from the discomforts of ambiguity and of having to decide things in the face of conflicting evidence and competing wants. But scientific planning is a mirage. Science and planning are very different sorts of enterprise . . . scientists seek to observe, describe, and explain ... Planners are quite the opposite; their purposes are to change whatever it is they are confronting, preferably, of course, to improve it. (Webber, 1983, quoted in Faludi, 1987, p. 46)

There is little to add to this passionate and accurate summing up of the impact of systems planning on the profession. While we might question the assumption of planning as control we should equally not reject the need of planning to project, understand and model. The whole approach of attempting to model and predict impacts, therefore, has rightly remained part of planning. There is a danger of dismissing systems planning as a tool within planning with systems planning per se. This has been helped by systems planners themselves. There was a confusion by the advocates of systems planning concerning ends and means. Cities can be treated like systems and undoubtedly they are complex adaptive systems. This can be useful in helping our understanding of how cities and regions work - retail impact assessments are a clear example of current ways in which we see impacts of planning decisions being more than simply local and physical. But an acceptance of cities and regions as systems does not necessitate an approach that plans them in such a way with the various implications that entails. Where,for example, is the role of public participation in a systems view? McLoughlin (1969, pp. 120-2) believes that goals should be formulated through a 'dialogue between professionals and politicians'. He goes on to list who he considers to be 'politicians' and

includes such groups as trade unions, churches, etc ., 'and, in certain instances, the public at large' (1969, p. 121). A systems perspective is highly 'planner-centric' in that it places a great deal of emphasis upon professional opinion in an abstracted and technical process where goals flow from analysis of problems - congestion requires more roads, poor-quality housing requires wholesale clearance and the erection of tower-blocks. In this respect it shares some of the criticisms that have been aimed at rational process planning discussed below.

As Faludi rightly points out, McLoughlin came to criticize his systems work for these very reasons: 'The system approach, operational research, mathematical models and cybernetics provided at the end of the 1960s a wonderful justification for a bureaucratisch profession and its academic counterpart' (quoted in Faludi, 1987, p. 45). The legacy of systems planning has been a feeling that, given enough computing power, cities can be modeled. There is a tendency in planning theory, particularly in the post-positivist era, to dismiss such ideas in favour of a more collaborative or communicative approach (see Chapter 9). In practice, systems approaches still have an important role to play through, for example, Environmental Impact Assessment (see Wilson, 2000). I cover more recent developments in Chapter 8.

There is one further development that is worth mentioning. Although Faludi and others dismissed systems planning as being unachievable, the idea of systems and, in particular, complex adaptive systems in nature and human society began to take off again in the late 1980s. In the face of the inability of models to understand and predict complex behavior, a number of fields in the natural and human sciences have begun to develop more sophisticated conceptions. The two areas that are currently being developed involve ideas around chaos and complexity. Both fields of theory have sought to address the more involved and intricate dimensions of systems. As opposed to the more rational and utility-maximizing aspects of the 1970s understanding of systems, complex systems are characterized by:

- a great many independent agents interacting with each other in a great many ways
- spontaneous self-organization
- adaption and (co) evolution
Â - dynamism. (Waldrop, 1992, p. 11)

The main difference is that McLoughlin's conception of a city was what would be now termed 'simple', that is, based on linear and predictable behavior. Complexity theory instead emphasizes a great deal more irregular behavior (Table 3.1).

This does not necessarily mean that we cannot 'plan' or model. It does, however, emphasize a more modest and contextualized approach that recognizes that aggregate human behavior is not always reducible to a simple formula. It also raises the point that we should not put too much hope on computing power being able to one day model the city.

The notions of complexity and chaos have acted as a stimulus to the resurgence in systems-based understandings and models of places. Using methods such as cellular automata, researchers have begun to model the dynamics and interactions of cities and the consider the impact of policy interventions, including planning (Byrne, 1998; Batty, 2005).
