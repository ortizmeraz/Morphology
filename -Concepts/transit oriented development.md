# Transit Oriented Development
## Definition
### Calthorpe, 1993
 Calthorpe specifically defined TOD as a “mixed-use community within average 2000-foot [AN: 600 m] walking distance of a transit stop and core commercial area. TODs mix residential, retail, office, open space, and public uses in a walkable environment, making it convenient for residents and employees to travel by transit, bicycle, foot, or car”. 
  Additionally, a “secondary area” related to TOD might appear at the maximum distance of 1.6 km from the core zone, where low-density housing, vast park areas, schools and other facilities for local community could be placed. The street network of this outer area should secure easy, fast and direct access to the core, especially by bicycle, and provide park-and-ride lots.
