# Coverage (GSI)
## Definition

### From Space Density and Urban From ()

GSI, or coverage, demonstrates the relationship between built and non-built space and is  
calculated as follows for all levels of scale as described earlier:

   $GSI=\frac{B_{x}}{A_{x}}$
   $B_{x}=$ footprint of  $(m^{2})$
   $A_{x} =$ area of aggregation x$(m^{2})$
  $x=$ aggregation (lot(l), island(i), fabric(f), or district(d))
