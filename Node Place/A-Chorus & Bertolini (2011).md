```ad-abstract
The high level of integration between railway and real estate development in Tokyo makes the city an interesting example for other metropolitan areas looking for ways to promote transit-oriented development. To successfully promote such a development pattern, an understanding of development dynamics in station areas is crucial. In this paper, a node place model is used to determine which transport and land use factors are responsible for structuring station area redevelopments in Tokyo, and to what extent. Thee interaction between specific transport and land use features—most importantly, proximity by train to the central business district and the number of train connections versus workforce concentration—is a powerful force structuring developments in Tokyo. However, other factors—most notably government policies—should also be taken into account.

## Bullet points

The Node Value
1. **Number of train connections.** Ridership and the number of train connections are closely related. In general, a station that offers multiple connections will attract more passengers than a station that only offers one connection.
2. **Type of train connections.** In Tokyo, private railways operate several types of train service on their lines. These range from train services that stop at every station to services that only stop at a certain number of stations.
3. **Proximity to CBD by rail.** Tokyo station (CBD?) is situated in the heart of the historic central business district. More than 4000 companies, including the head offices of many national and international firms, are located in the surrounding area, contributing to approximately 20 percent of Japans gross domestic product.
4. **Number of bus lines departing from a station.** Buses in the Tokyo metropolitan area serve a secondary role, carrying passengers to and from train stations.

The Place Value
1. **Population around the station.** In Tokyo, the construction of private railway lines went hand in hand with the development of the surrounding areas.
2. **Economic cluster 1: Services and administration.** The GIS data available for Tokyo were the number of workers in offices, branch offices, and offices in houses.
3. **Economic cluster 2: Retail, hotel, and catering.** The GIS data available for Tokyo were the number of workers in stores and restaurants.
4. **Economic cluster 3: Industry and distribution.** The GIS data available for Tokyo were the number of workers in transport distribution centers and warehouses, private warehouses, gas stations, factories, and crafts.
5. **Economic cluster 4: Education, health, and culture.** The GIS data available for Tokyo were the number of workers in schools, hospitals, temples, inns, and bathhouses.
6. **Degree of multifunctionality** In Tokyo, stations are the true urban centers of the city as most shops, restaurants, offices, and amusement facilities are concentrated around them. However, this does not mean that all stations have the same function.

**A stressed station area: The case of Shinjuku Station**

- Shinjuku is the busiest station in the world in terms of number of passengers served. Daily the station is used by an average of three million people.
- Shinjuku is identified by the node-place model as a stressed station area. This means that both the node and place functions have been used to the fullest. Improving the transport provision and/or the further development of the station area could easily cause conflicts due to the limited amount of space available.
- Out of the 13 subway lines in Tokyo, 11 offer this kind of regional through service.
- As far as the place dimension is concerned, currently the south side of Shinjuku Station is being redeveloped. An artificial ground has been created above the railway tracks on which a multistorey structure will be built.

**An unbalanced node: The case of Ueno Station**
- Urawa is an example of an unbalanced place. This station should, following the reasoning of the land use transport feedback cycle, either increase its level of train services or develop in a lower- density fashion (in relative terms).
- The area around Urawa Station is an important government center, with many of the prefecture’s governmental offices such as the city hall and the prefectural office and court, concentrated nearby, as well as the prefectural library.

**Conclusions**
· As the three examples have illustrated, the node-place model cannot predict development, but can be used to gain a better understanding of development dynamics. Without the node-place model, we would not be able to determine the relative position of a station within the urban regional network. ăis would have made it more difficult to explain their actual development patterns. However, some critical remarks can be made about the node-place model.

- On the land use side, the government could stimulate the development of these locations by assigning them higher FAR values than their surroundings and by providing road systems that make it possible to actually build such volumes. However, the latter measure can be especially time-consuming and expensive as large parts of the built-up area in Tokyo are still characterized by narrow roads. Widening the roads will arouse considerable community opposition, as it may disrupt entire neighborhoods.
- On the transport side, the position of stations in the network could be further improved by establishing new connections with other railway lines and by increasing the number of rapid services thereby reducing travel time and the number of transfers.
- Last but not least, we recognize the limits of the specific application of the node-place model in this paper. Three cases cannot give sufficient insight into the development dynamics of station areas within a metropolitan area. For this, a more systematic analysis is needed in, ideally including analysis of development in all station areas that make up the metropolitan railway network.
