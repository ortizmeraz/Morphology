The urban street had traditionally united three physical roles: that of circulation route, that of public space, and that of built frontage. These three elements may be loosely equated with the linear concern of the transport engineer (the street as a one-dimensional ‘link’ in the traffic network), the planar concern of the planner (streetspace as land use) and the three dimensional concern of the architect or urban designer (Figure 1.4).

**The schism of Modernism**

This effectively amounted to a schism in urban design between the treatment of roads as movement channels, and the treatment of buildings and public space. It led to a deconstruction and separation of the elements of the street (Figure 1.6). What applied to the product also applied to the process, resulting in a division of labour between the design professions. Road layout became the preserve of highway engineers and traffic engineers, specialising in the sciences of traffic flow and the engineering design of infrastructure. Meanwhile, the architects concentrated on the buildings, creating new works of ‘urban sculpture’.14 The result was that street design became subsumed within the rather specialised discipline of road design – based on the scientific considerations of traffic flow and the kinetics of vehicular motion, practised by engineers trained in hydraulics and mechanics, rather than architects trained in spatial form and aesthetics, or planners versed in the arts of the public realm. The single-minded pursuit of traffic-driven approaches almost reduced the whole ‘town planning’ process to an elaborate and obscure mathematical calculation to optimise a very limited number of variables – such as the ‘peak hour passenger car unit flow rate’ – to which everything else was subordinated.P7 (Marshall, 2004)

Since the early 1990s, movements such as New Urbanism have drawn attention to the problem of roads-driven disurban creation, and have taken the initiative towards solving it. The rhetoric of the ‘motor age’ has been replaced by the rhetoric of sustainability and neo-traditional urbanism. Compact, dense, mixed-use neighbourhoods are back in fashion, with a new breed of traditional-style buildings and street patterns to choose from. The street itself, once seemingly in terminal decline, has undergone something of a renaissance. Street grids are back in vogue. P9 (Marshall, 2004)

Hand in hand with this neo-traditional urbanism are what we could call neo-traditional transport policies. That original form of transport – walking – is now lauded as the most favoured mode of movement, followed closely by cycling, with both complemented by public transport for longer journeys. Traffic engineers trained to squeeze the maximum traffic flow out of city streets are now urged to ‘calm’ those streets, slowing down traffic and giving space back to the pedestrians. P9 (Marshall, 2004)

**Transport and urban structure**

Transport is not just another land use. In other words, transport infrastructure and streetspace are not just any arbitrary part of a two-dimensional tessellation of land use parcels. The design of street pattern is not just a matter of distributing the land use labelled ‘transport’ here and there to fit within a patchwork of other urban spaces and places. To a significant extent street pattern is – and must be – influenced by the geometry of movement and the topology of route connectivity. P13 (Marshall, 2004)

**So streetspace forms the basic core of all urban public space – and by extension, all public space – forming a contiguous network or continuum** by which everything is linked to everything else. This continuum is punctured by plots of private land. The plots of private land surrounded by public streets are like an archipelago of islands set in a sea of public space.32 Just as every sea port, no matter how large or small, is directly connected to every other sea port, every access point to a plot of land or urban block leads to every other access point essentially through the medium of the public street system (Figure 1.12). P13 (Marshall, 2004)

To say that transport is key to urban structuring does not imply that ‘transport’ as an urban function or land use is more important than ‘housing’ or ‘open space’. Nor does it mean that transport is the only influence on the pattern of streets and land parcels: clearly, these patterns will be influenced by topography, land ownership, land value and other social, economic and physical factors. However, it does mean that close attention to the structural logic of the access network is important for understanding how existing cities are structured and how new ones may be designed. P.14

**Street type**

The issue of street type is important because it leads from description of type to prescription of type. In other words, the types of street that are systematically recognised in design guidance will influence the types of street that are designed and built. If certain types of street are not recognised, and do not feature in design guidance, then these types may disappear, there being no adequate guidance or specifications available for employing them. Even the street itself – as an urban route type in the first place – might be in danger, if the category ‘street’ is denied in official guidance geared to the design of ‘urban roads’. Therefore, in order to meet today’s needs for streets-oriented urban design guidance, we need to be aware of what kinds of urban route and street are potentially available. P.23

Particularly influential has been the idea of a ‘functional’ classification, in which roads are classified according to their (intended) function, rather than their (present) form.8 An example of conventional ‘functional’ hierarchy is that given in the UK professional manual Transport in the Urban Environment (Table 2.1). P.24

**Street type and hierarchy**

Systems of road hierarchy which specify a limited typology or ‘hierarchy’ of allowable street types – typically expressed as road types – have been criticised for being apparently based on traffic flow or road capacity.28 The classification may appear to be a rather narrow ranking, which appears to prioritise vehicular traffic over other modes. In fact, the basis for specification of type is not clear or consistent. Although conventional road hierarchy is based on ‘functional’ classification, there is ambiguity about whether the function refers to what a street ‘functions as’ (e.g. a rat run) or refers solely to its intended function is (e.g. street for local traffic). P.34

**Hierarchy versus pattern**

Hierarchy and pattern are often confused: the terms are often used ambiguously and apparently interchangeably. Table 2.3 gives some examples of the mix of uses of the terms. In effect, the term ‘hierarchical’ is commonly used to denote a tributary (‘loop and cul-de-sac’) layout, in contradistinction to traditional grid layouts, even though grid layouts may also be hierarchical in nature, either by design or emergence. In other words, the adoption of a particular layout (e.g. grid) does not preclude the retention of a particular kind of hierarchy. Indeed, the kind of ‘integrated grid network’ envisaged by advocates of neo-traditional urbanism may well have greater differentiation of route types than conventional ‘hierarchical’ road networks (Chapter 6).

Design guidance may inadvertently reinforce the confusion of the verbal descriptions by use of graphic depictions. The expression of a desired hierarchy may suggest a diagram depicting a particular pattern. As Ray Brindle points out, conventional road classifications typically ‘depict roads as forming a tributary (i.e. tree) system, each road picking up traffic from less important roads and channelling it to more important roads’.33 While this is indeed often the case, the depicted pattern does not necessarily follow from the underlying rules of hierarchy (Figure 2.12).

**Preferred versus discouraged patterns**

The ongoing debate on street pattern often boils down to a simple polarity between ‘grid’ network forms versus ‘tributary’ (or ‘loop and cul-de-sac’) forms. But justification of these preferences is a complex and to some extent contradictory issue.

1. What kind of pattern? A pattern of streets may comprise any or all of: a pattern of roads, a pattern of paths, and a pattern of blocks or plots of land. While in some cases these may be coincident, in other cases there may be different patterns serving different purposes (Figure 2.14).34

2. Clarity, identity and legibility. Conventional tributary (loop and cul-de-sac) networks may be criticised on the basis that they lack a ‘clear structure and identity’. However, a grid is not necessarily ‘clearer’ or more ‘structured’ than a tree pattern. Some research results suggest that grids may have fewer ‘identifiable’ districts than curvilinear suburban patterns. And the Urban Design Compendium promotes a ‘hierarchy of routes and places’ to assist the objective of legibility. Perhaps it is more the differentiation or regularity of pattern, rather than whether this is a grid or a tree, that is at stake.35 P.36

3. ‘Traditional’ versus ‘neo-traditional’. Although neo-traditional design may favour permeable street networks, it is not uncommon to see neo-traditional designs with liberal use of culs-de-sac. Indeed, Michael Southworth has demonstrated that some neo-traditional designs may resemble conventional ‘auto-oriented’ suburbs as much as traditional grid-based neighbourhoods, in terms of proportions of crossroads and culs-de-sac.36 P.38

4. ‘Concentration’ versus ‘dispersal’. One of the neo-traditionalists’ arguments in favour of ‘permeable’ street networks is that the route options offered by the grid ‘disperse’ traffic, ‘rather than forcing all traffic onto increasingly crowded collector and arterial streets’.37 However, these oversimplify the dynamics of traffic networks. Ray Brindle observes that ‘Recently there has been much talk of the “permeability” of networks which has, in part, generated mischievous theories about the ideal structure of local networks.’ He warns of the dangers of transport planners and traffic engineers being seduced by the rhetoric of neo-traditionalist planners with their preference for the grid.38 P.38

5. ‘Geometric’ versus ‘organic’. Finally, even the merits of the grid from an ‘urbanist’ point of view cannot be taken for granted, and have for long enough been subject to criticism from a variety of quarters. Camillo Sitte, perhaps one of the most famous pioneers of a ‘neo-traditional’ approach, was certainly against rigid engineering solutions. However, he also strongly argued against the use of crossroads, grid planning and monumental symmetrical layouts – three of the characteristic hallmarks of many of today’s New Urbanist designs. We could say that Sitte’s brand of neotraditional design was ‘organic’ rather than ‘geometric’. P.38

Le Corbusier’s vision had no need for traditional main streets such as avenues or boulevards – so no pavement cafés, and no Champs-Elysées. This was not an oversight: the demise of the traditional street was Le Corbusier’s express intention. He intuitively knew the logistical power the street had in binding up cities in their old ways. So when he attacked the traditional city, he went for the jugular. P.45

**Conventional road hierarchy**

Conventional road hierarchy is not only to do with the functional efficiency of traffic flow, but is also concerned with the safety, amenity and the environmental quality of urban areas.5 It therefore does take account of nontraffic considerations in the urban context, although it often appears to do so by putting the traffic first, and fitting the other concerns around that.

While the terminology differs in each case, the basic principles follow the same general pattern, with a spectrum from major roads to minor roads. Major roads tend to be associated with strategic routes, heavier traffic flows, higher design speeds, with limited access to minor roads with frontage access. Minor roads tend to be associated with more lightly trafficked, local routes, with lower design speeds and more frequent access points and with access to building frontages. The consequences of these associations are as follows.

1. Roads designated as ‘streets’ – implying built frontages and public space – are normally found at the lower end of the spectrum.

2. There tends to be greatest segregation of transport modes implied at either extreme of these hierarchies: segregated vehicular traffic at one end and segregated pedestrians at the other, with all-purpose roads in between.

3. Most route types appear to be designated according to transport or traffic function, although some at the lower end (e.g. street, mews, etc.) also imply relationships with buildings. P. 47

The problem with the conventional hierarchy is that it imposes an artificial relationship between ‘mobility’ and ‘access’. In effect, there appear to be two dimensions, but these are bound together in a single, inverse relationship (Figure 3.4).11 This means that any street that does not fit onto this ‘idealised’ relationship does not fit into the classification (Figure 3.5). The result is that the classification cannot represent the actual street types found on the ground. This means that not only is the classification no longer a reflection of today’s aspirations, but it is not capable of representing the range of existing street types – and never was.12 P.50

# Urban mobility and urban form

## Econometric analyses

Land consumption depends directly on the relative compactness of human settlements and on residential density; energy consumption, on the other hand, depends indirectly on the same variables, via their linkage with mobility patterns: trip length and modal choice between private and public means. P200

The demand for mobility, and in particular the growing dependence on private vehicles for intra-metropolitan trips, is currently a crucial component in the debate on sustainable urban development, given the economic, social and environmental impact for which it is responsible. P202

A diffused pattern of urban development, almost by definition, cannot be adequately served by the public transport infrastructure since the demand density is low, the scattering of the demand over the territory is high and the dispersion of destinations is also growing because of the suburbanisation of jobs. This is the reason why so many analyses of the social, economic and environmental costs of urban expansion have concentrated on the pervasive presence of the automobile: a technology capable of ‘bringing places nearer’ by providing access to the increasingly dispersed and specialised urban functions (Cervero, 1998; Newman and Kenworthy, 1999). P202

One question posed by many researchers, and also examined in the present investigation, is whether it is possible to demonstrate a significant relationship between mobility consumption and the morphology of urban development. In this connection, it is interesting that an empirical analysis undertaken recently in the Paris metropolitan area shows a direct relationship between the rate of car ownership and distance of the area of residence from the centre, and also an indirect relationship between the demographic density of the area of residence and variables such as the rate of car ownership, the distance travelled each day and the per capita consumption of petrol (Fouchier, 1998). P203

The working hypothesis is that within a relatively homogeneous area (in terms of income level and general socio-economic conditions), such as the province of Milano, the local differences in the mobility patterns (time and mode) can, at least to a certain extent, be attributed to the form in which urban growth has occurred. Mobility therefore has the role of dependent variable, while the form of development and its dynamics represent the independent variables.

Four types of independent variables were adopted (see Appendix A for statistical details and definition of variables): geographical variables: distance from Milan; socio-economic variables: population density, size and dynamics, age of buildings, ratio of jobs to resident population (Emp/Res); morphology: i.e. the typologies of urban development previously described, reduced to four classes: infilling-extension; extension-linear; sprawl; large-scale projects (see Appendix A); accessibility and transport efficiency: competitiveness of public transport, share of public transport, average trip time for public transport trips (Public time) and private transport trips (Priate time).
